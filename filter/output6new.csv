ACM DL,conferencePaper,2019,"Behind the Curtain of the ""Ultimate Empathy Machine"": On the Composition of Virtual Reality Nonfiction Experiences",CHI - Human Factors in Computing Systems,A*,"Virtual Reality nonfiction (VRNF) is an emerging form of immersive media experience created for consumption using panoramic ""Virtual Reality"" headsets. VRNF promises nonfiction content producers the potential to create new ways for audiences to experience ""the real""; allowing viewers to transition from passive spectators to active participants. Our current project is exploring VRNF through a series of ethnographic and experimental studies. In order to document the content available, we embarked on an analysis of VR documentaries produced to date. In this paper, we present an analysis of a representative sample of 150 VRNF titles released between 2012-2018. We identify and quantify 64 characteristics of the medium over this period, discuss how producers are exploiting the affordances of VR, and shed light on new audience roles. Our findings provide insight into the current state of the art in VRNF and provide a digital resource for other researchers in this area.",virtual reality; interaction; immersive media; nonfiction
ACM DL,conferencePaper,2017,Malleable Embodiment: Changing Sense of Embodiment by Spatial-Temporal Deformation of Virtual Human Body,CHI - Human Factors in Computing Systems,A*,"We hypothesize that replacing the visual perception of one's body with a spatial-temporal deformed state would change sensations associated with the body. We developed a system that captures full-body movement and generates estimated past and future body movement by deformation. With a head mounted display, people could see their bodies as slightly deformed. We then investigated 1) how human movement is physically changed, and 2) how humans feel about the change in physical and emotional views of the body due to virtual body deformation. Our results show that spatial-temporal deformation of a virtual body actually changes the sense of body as well as physical movement. For instance, a body image generated at approximately 25-100 ms in the future induced a ""lighter weight"" sensation. On the basis of our findings, we discuss the design implication of computational control for the physical and emotional sense of body.","""body ownership""; ""embodiment""; ""motion""; ""perception""; ""virtual reality"""
