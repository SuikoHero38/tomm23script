ACM DL,conferencePaper,2021,MaMIoT: Manipulation of Energy Market Leveraging High Wattage IoT Botnets,CCS - ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security,A*,"If a trader could predict price changes in the stock market better than other traders, she would make a fortune. Similarly in the electricity market, a trader that could predict changes in the electricity load, and thus electricity prices, would be able to make large profits. Predicting price changes in the electricity market better than other market participants is hard, but in this paper, we show that attackers can manipulate the electricity prices in small but predictable ways, giving them a competitive advantage in the market.Our attack is possible when the adversary controls a botnet of high wattage devices such as air conditioning units, which are able to abruptly change the total demand of the power grid. Such attacks are called Manipulation of Demand via IoT (MaDIoT) attacks. In this paper, we present a new variant of MaDIoT and name it Manipulation of Market via IoT (MaMIoT). MaMIoT is the first energy market manipulation cyberattack that leverages high wattage IoT botnets to slightly change the total demand of the power grid with the aim of affecting the electricity prices in the favor of specific market players. Using real-world data obtained from two major energy markets, we show that MaMIoT can significantly increase the profit of particular market players or financially damage a group of players depending on the motivation of the attacker.",electricity market manipulation; financial profit/damage; high wattage iot botnet
ACM DL,conferencePaper,2021,Glowworm Attack: Optical TEMPEST Sound Recovery via a Device's Power Indicator LED,CCS - ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security,A*,"Two main classes of optical TEMPEST attacks against the confidentiality of information processed/delivered by devices have been demonstrated in the past two decades; the first class includes methods for recovering content from monitors, and the second class includes methods for recovering keystrokes from physical and virtual keyboards. In this paper, we identify a new class of optical TEMPEST attacks: recovering sound by analyzing optical emanations from a device's power indicator LED. We analyze the response of the power indicator LED of various devices to sound and show that there is an optical correlation between the sound that is played by connected speakers and the intensity of their power indicator LED due to the facts that: (1) the power indicator LED of various devices is connected directly to the power line, (2) the intensity of a device's power indicator LED is correlative to the power consumption, and (3) many devices lack a dedicated means of countering this phenomenon. Based on our findings, we present the Glowworm attack, an optical TEMPEST attack that can be used by eavesdroppers to recover sound by analyzing optical measurements obtained via an electro-optical sensor directed at the power indicator LED of various devices (e.g., speakers, USB hub splitters, and microcontrollers). We propose an optical-audio transformation (OAT) to recover sound in which we isolate the speech from optical measurements obtained by directing an electro-optical sensor at a device's power indicator LED. Finally, we test the performance of the Glowworm attack in various experimental setups and show that an eavesdropper can apply the attack to recover speech from speakers' power LED indicator with good intelligibility from a distance of 15 meters and with fair intelligibility from 35 meters.",IoT; privacy; sound recovery; tempest
ACM DL,conferencePaper,2022,Power Contracts: Provably Complete Power Leakage Models for Processors,CCS - ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security,A*,"The protection of cryptographic software implementations against power-analysis attacks is critical for applications in embedded systems. A commonly used algorithmic countermeasure against these attacks is masking, a secret-sharing scheme that splits a sensitive computation into computations on multiple random shares. In practice, the security of masking schemes relies on several assumptions that are often violated by microarchitectural side-effects of CPUs. Many past works address this problem by studying these leakage effects and building corresponding leakage models that can then be integrated into a software verification workflow. However, these models have only been derived empirically, putting in question the otherwise rigorous security statements made with verification. We solve this problem in two steps. First, we introduce a contract layer between the (CPU) hardware and the software that allows the specification of microarchitectural side-effects on masked software in an intuitive language. Second, we present a method for proving the correspondence between contracts and CPU netlists to ensure the completeness of the specified leakage models. Then, any further security proofs only need to happen between software and contract, which brings benefits such as reduced verification runtime, improved user experience, and the possibility of working with vendor-supplied contracts of CPUs whose design is not available on netlist-level due to IP restrictions. We apply our approach to the popular RISC-V IBEX core, provide a corresponding formally verified contract, and describe how this contract could be used to verify masked software implementations.",contract; domain-specific language; leakage model; masking; power side-channel; probing security; verification
ACM DL,conferencePaper,2022,HammerScope: Observing DRAM Power Consumption Using Rowhammer,CCS - ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security,A*,"The constant reduction in memory cell sizes has increased memory density and reduced power consumption, but has also affected its reliability. The Rowhammer attack exploits this reduced reliability to induce bit flips in memory, without directly accessing these bits. Most Rowhammer attacks target software integrity, but some recent attacks demonstrated its use for compromising confidentiality. Continuing this trend, in this paper we observe that the rh attack strongly correlates with the memory instantaneous power consumption. We exploit this observation to design HammerScope, a Rowhammer-based attack technique for measuring the power consumption of the memory unit. Because the power consumption correlates with the level of activity of the memory, hs allows an attacker to infer memory activity. To demonstrate the offensive capabilities of HammerScope, we use it to mount three information leakage attacks. We first show that hs can be used to break kernel address-space layout randomization (KASLR). Our second attack uses memory activity as a covert channel for a Spectre attack, allowing us to leak information from the operating system kernel. Finally, we demonstrate the use of HammerScope for performing website fingerprinting, compromising user privacy. Our work demonstrates the importance of finding systematic solutions for Rowhammer attacks.",rowhammer; side-channel attack
IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,C3APSULe: Cross-FPGA Covert-Channel Attacks through Power Supply Unit Leakage,SP - IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy,A*,"Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are versatile, reconfigurable integrated circuits that can be used as hardware accelerators to process highly-sensitive data. Leaking this data and associated cryptographic keys, however, can undermine a system's security. To prevent potentially unintentional interactions that could break separation of privilege between different data center tenants, FPGAs in cloud environments are currently dedicated on a per-user basis. Nevertheless, while the FPGAs themselves are not shared among different users, other parts of the data center infrastructure are. This paper specifically shows for the first time that powering FPGAs, CPUs, and GPUs through the same power supply unit (PSU) can be exploited in FPGA-to-FPGA, CPU-to-FPGA, and GPU-to-FPGA covert channels between independent boards. These covert channels can operate remotely, without the need for physical access to, or modifications of, the boards. To demonstrate the attacks, this paper uses a novel combination of ""sensing"" and ""stressing"" ring oscillators as receivers on the sink FPGA. Further, ring oscillators are used as transmitters on the source FPGA. The transmitting and receiving circuits are used to determine the presence of the leakage on off-the-shelf Xilinx boards containing Artix 7 and Kintex 7 FPGA chips. Experiments are conducted with PSUs by two vendors, as well as CPUs and GPUs of different generations. Moreover, different sizes and types of ring oscillators are also tested. In addition, this work discusses potential countermeasures to mitigate the impact of the cross-board leakage. The results of this paper highlight the dangers of shared power supply units in local and cloud FPGAs, and therefore a fundamental need to re-think FPGA security for shared infrastructures.",Power supply units;voltage regulators;ring oscillators;FPGAs;covert channels;power attacks
IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,PLATYPUS: Software-based Power Side-Channel Attacks on x86,SP - IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy,A*,"Power side-channel attacks exploit variations in power consumption to extract secrets from a device, e.g., cryptographic keys. Prior attacks typically required physical access to the target device and specialized equipment such as probes and a high-resolution oscilloscope.In this paper, we present PLATYPUS attacks, which are novel software-based power side-channel attacks on Intel server, desktop, and laptop CPUs. We exploit unprivileged access to the Intel Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) interface that exposes values directly correlated with power consumption, forming a low-resolution side channel.We show that with sufficient statistical evaluation, we can observe variations in power consumption, which distinguish different instructions and different Hamming weights of operands and memory loads. This enables us to not only monitor the control flow of applications but also to infer data and extract cryptographic keys. We demonstrate how an unprivileged attacker can leak AES-NI keys from Intel SGX and the Linux kernel, break kernel address-space layout randomization (KASLR), infer secret instruction streams, and establish a timing-independent covert channel. We also present a privileged attack on mbed TLS, utilizing precise execution control to recover RSA keys from an SGX enclave. We discuss countermeasures and show that mitigating these attacks in a privileged context is not trivial.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Volttack: Control IoT Devices by Manipulating Power Supply Voltage,SP - IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy,A*,"This paper analyzes the security of Internet of Things (IoT) devices from the perspective of sensing and actuating. Particularly, we discover a vulnerability in power supply modules and propose Volttack attacks. To launch a Volttack attack, attackers may compromise the power source and inject malicious signals through the power supply module, which is indispensable in most devices. Eventually, Volttack attacks may cause the sensor measurement irrelevant to reality or maneuver the actuator in a way disregarding the desired command. To understand Volttack, we systematically analyze the underlying principle of power supply signals affecting the electronic components, which are building blocks to constitute the sensor or actuator modules. Derived from these findings, we implement and validate Volttack on off-the-shelf products: 6 sensors and 3 actuators, which are used in applications ranging from automobile braking systems, industrial process control to robotic arms. The consequences of manipulating the sensor measurement or actuation include doubled car braking distance and a natural gas leak. The root cause of such a vulnerability stems from the common belief that noises from the power line are unintentional, and our work aims to call for attention to enhancing the security of power supply modules and adding countermeasures to mitigate the attacks.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2021,ROSITA: Towards Automatic Elimination of Power-Analysis Leakage in Ciphers,NDSS - Usenix Network and Distributed System Security Symposium,A*,"Since their introduction over two decades ago, side-channel attacks have presented a serious security threat. While many ciphers' implementations employ masking techniques to protect against such attacks, they often leak secret information due to unintended interactions in the hardware. We present ROSITA, a code rewrite engine that uses a leakage emulator which we amend to correctly emulate the micro-architecture of a target system. We use ROSITA to automatically protect masked implementations of AES, ChaCha, and Xoodoo. For AES and Xoodoo, we show the absence of observable leakage at 1 000 000 traces with less than 21% penalty to the performance. For ChaCha, which has significantly more leakage, ROSITA eliminates over 99% of the leakage, at a performance cost of 64%.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2022,AMD Prefetch Attacks through Power and Time,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Modern operating systems fundamentally rely on the strict isolation of user applications from the kernel. This isolation is enforced by the hardware. On Intel CPUs, this isolation has been shown to be imperfect, for instance, with the prefetch side-channel. With Meltdown, it was even completely circumvented. Both the prefetch side channel and Meltdown have been mitigated with the same software patch on Intel. As AMD is believed to be not vulnerable to these attacks, this software patch is not active by default on AMD CPUs. In this paper, we show that the isolation on AMD CPUs suffers from the same type of side-channel leakage. We discover timing and power variations of the prefetch instruction that can be observed from unprivileged user space. In contrast to previous work on prefetch attacks on Intel, we show that the prefetch instruction on AMD leaks even more information. We demonstrate the significance of this side channel with multiple case studies in real-world scenarios. We demonstrate the first microarchitectural break of (fine-grained) KASLR on AMD CPUs. We monitor kernel activity, e.g., if audio is played over Bluetooth, and establish a covert channel. Finally, we even leak kernel memory with 52.85 B/s with simple Spectre gadgets in the Linux kernel. We show that stronger page table isolation should be activated on AMD CPUs by default to mitigate our presented attacks successfully.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2022,Hertzbleed: Turning Power Side-Channel Attacks Into Remote Timing Attacks on x86,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Power side-channel attacks exploit data-dependent variations in a CPU's power consumption to leak secrets. In this paper, we show that on modern Intel (and AMD) x86 CPUs, power side-channel attacks can be turned into timing attacks that can be mounted without access to any power measurement interface. Our discovery is enabled by dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). We find that, under certain circumstances, DVFS-induced variations in CPU frequency depend on the current power consumption (and hence, data) at the granularity of milliseconds. Making matters worse, these variations can be observed by a remote attacker, since frequency differences translate to wall time differences! The frequency side channel is theoretically more powerful than the software side channels considered in cryptographic engineering practice today, but it is difficult to exploit because it has a coarse granularity. Yet, we show that this new channel is a real threat to the security of cryptographic software. First, we reverse engineer the dependency between data, power, and frequency on a modern x86 CPU-finding, among other things, that differences as seemingly minute as a set bit's position in a word can be distinguished through frequency changes. Second, we describe a novel chosen-ciphertext attack against (constant-time implementations of) SIKE, a post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism, that amplifies a single key-bit guess into many thousands of high- or low-power operations, allowing full key extraction via remote timing.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2022,Hiding in Plain Sight? On the Efficacy of Power Side Channel-Based Control Flow Monitoring,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Physical side-channel monitoring leverages the physical phenomena produced by a microcontroller (e.g. power consumption or electromagnetic radiation) to monitor program execution for malicious behavior. As such, it offers a promising intrusion detection solution for resource-constrained embedded systems, which are incompatible with conventional security measures. This method is especially relevant in safety and security-critical embedded systems such as in industrial control systems. Side-channel monitoring poses unique challenges for would-be attackers, such as: (1) limiting attack vectors by being physically isolated from the monitored system, (2) monitoring immutable physical side channels with uninterpretable data-driven models, and (3) being specifically trained for the architectures and programs on which they are applied to. As a result, physical side-channel monitors are conventionally believed to provide a high level of security. In this paper, we propose a novel attack to illustrate that, despite the many barriers to attack that side-channel monitoring systems create, they are still vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We present a method for crafting functional malware such that, when injected into a side-channel-monitored system, the detector is not triggered. Our experiments reveal that this attack is robust across detector models and hardware implementations. We evaluate our attack on the popular ARM microcontroller platform on several representative programs, demonstrating the feasibility of such an attack and highlighting the need for further research into side-channel monitors.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2021,Charger-Surfing: Exploiting a Power Line Side-Channel for Smartphone Information Leakage,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Touchscreen-based mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are used daily by billions of people for productivity and entertainment. This paper uncovers a new security threat posed by a side-channel leakage through the power line, called Charger-Surfing, which targets these touchscreen devices. We reveal that while a smartphone is charging, its power trace, which can be measured via the USB charging cable, leaks information about the dynamic content on its screen. This information can be utilized to determine the location on the touchscreen where an animation is played by the mobile OS to indicate, for instance, that a button press has been registered. We develop a portable, low cost power trace collection system for the side-channel construction. This leakage channel is thoroughly evaluated on various smartphones running Android or iOS, equipped with the two most commonly used screen technologies (LCD and OLED). We validate the effectiveness of Charger-Surfing by conducting a case study on a passcode unlock screen. Our experiments show that an adversary can exploit Charger-Surfing across a wide range of smartphone models to achieve an average accuracy of 98.7% for single button inference, and an average of 95.1% or 92.8% accuracy on the first attempt when cracking a victim's 4-digit or 6-digit passcode, respectively. The inference accuracy increases to 99.3% (4-digit) or 96.9% (6-digit) within five trials. We further demonstrate the robustness of Charger-Surfing in realistic settings and discuss countermeasures against it.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2021,Cross-VM and Cross-Processor Covert Channels Exploiting Processor Idle Power Management,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"To achieve power-efficient computing, processors engage idle power management mechanisms to turn on/off idle components according to the dynamics of the workload. A processor's hardware components are classified and managed through the core and the uncore. The uncore is the supporting hardware shared by the cores, hence the decision of turning it on/off depends on the cores' activities. Such dependency implies a covert channel threat in multi-core platforms. Specifically, the power status of the uncore reflects the workload pattern of the active core, and it can be probed by any process running on the processor. This allows the process to infer the workload information of the active core. We show this covert channel can work across processors and violate VM isolation. We validate the channel in in-house testbeds as well as proprietary cloud servers.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2020,EcoFuzz: Adaptive Energy-Saving Greybox Fuzzing as a Variant of the Adversarial Multi-Armed Bandit,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Fuzzing is one of the most effective approaches for identifying security vulnerabilities. As a state-of-the-art coverage-based greybox fuzzer, AFL is a highly effective and widely used technique. However, AFL allocates excessive energy (i.e., the number of test cases generated by the seed) to seeds that exercise the high-frequency paths and can not adaptively adjust the energy allocation, thus wasting a significant amount of energy. Moreover, the current Markov model for modeling coverage-based greybox fuzzing is not profound enough. This paper presents a variant of the Adversarial Multi-Armed Bandit model for modeling AFL's power schedule process. We first explain the challenges in AFL's scheduling algorithm by using the reward probability that generates a test case for discovering a new path. Moreover, we illustrated the three states of the seeds set and developed a unique adaptive scheduling algorithm as well as a probability-based search strategy. These approaches are implemented on top of AFL in an adaptive energy-saving greybox fuzzer called EcoFuzz. EcoFuzz is examined against other six AFL-type tools on 14 real-world subjects over 490 CPU days. According to the results, EcoFuzz could attain 214% of the path coverage of AFL with reducing 32% test cases generation of that of AFL. Besides, EcoFuzz identified 12 vulnerabilities in GNU Binutils and other software. We also extended EcoFuzz to test some IoT devices and found a new vulnerability in the SNMP component.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,Examining Power Dynamics and User Privacy in Smart Technology Use Among Jordanian Households,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Smart technologies continue to raise concerns about privacy protection of both households and bystanders who may be targets of incidental or intentional monitoring. Domestic workers are an example of bystanders in smart homes who experience complex power dynamics and can be subjected to exploitative practices that are further facilitated through smart technology. Such power dynamics are rooted in complex social norms and customs, religious beliefs, and economics. While past research has focused on Western contexts to explore how smart technologies and power dynamics affect privacy of households and smart home bystanders, there is a limited understanding of the impact of such factors within non-Western contexts. This paper presents the findings from 30 interviews with smart device users and bystanders (households, and domestic workers), policy makers, and human and civil rights activists to explore smart home power dynamics in the Muslim Arab Middle Eastern (MAME) context of Jordan. We uncover how asymmetric socio-economic power dynamics between households and domestic workers influence smart technology privacy concerns, practices, and rights perceptions. Drawing on the findings of this study, we present some recommendations for interventions to balance asymmetric power dynamics, to improve bystanders' agency and privacy protection, and to prevent technology exploitation.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,Collide+Power: Leaking Inaccessible Data with Software-based Power Side Channels,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Differential Power Analysis (DPA) measures single-bit differences between data values used in computer systems by statistical analysis of power traces. In this paper, we show that the mere co-location of data values, e.g., attacker and victim data in the same buffers and caches, leads to power leakage in modern CPUs that depends on a combination of both values, resulting in a novel attack, Collide+Power. We systematically analyze the power leakage of the CPU's memory hierarchy to derive precise leakage models enabling practical end-to-end attacks. These attacks can be conducted in software with any signal related to power consumption, e.g., power consumption interfaces or throttling-induced timing variations. Leakage due to throttling requires 133.3 times more samples than direct power measurements. We develop a novel differential measurement technique amplifying the exploitable leakage by a factor of 8.778 on average, compared to a straightforward DPA approach. We demonstrate that Collide+Power leaks single-bit differences from the CPU's memory hierarchy with fewer than 23000 measurements. Collide+Power varies attacker-controlled data in our end-to-end DPA attacks. We present a Meltdown-style attack, leaking from attacker-chosen memory locations, and a faster MDS-style attack, which leaks 4.82 bit/h. Collide+Power is a generic attack applicable to any modern CPU, arbitrary memory locations, and victim applications and data. However, the Meltdown-style attack is not yet practical, as it is limited by the state of the art of prefetching victim data into the cache, leading to an unrealistic real-world attack runtime with throttling of more than a year for a single bit. Given the different variants and potentially more practical prefetching methods, we consider Collide+Power a relevant threat that is challenging to mitigate.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,Eavesdropping Mobile App Activity via Radio-Frequency Energy Harvesting,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Radio-frequency (RF) energy harvesting is a promising technology for Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to power sensors and prolong battery life. In this paper, we present a novel side-channel attack that leverages RF energy harvesting signals to eavesdrop mobile app activities. To demonstrate this novel attack, we propose AppListener, an automated attack framework that recognizes fine-grained mobile app activities from harvested RF energy. The RF energy is harvested from a custom-built RF energy harvester which generates voltage signals from ambient Wi-Fi transmissions, and app activities are recognized from a three-tier classification algorithm. We evaluate AppListener with four mobile devices running 40 common mobile apps (eg, YouTube, Facebook, and WhatsApp) belonging to five categories (ie, video, music, social media, communication, and game); each category contains five application-specific activities. Experiment results show that AppListener achieves over 99% accuracy in differentiating four different mobile devices, over 98% accuracy in classifying 40 different apps, and 86.7% accuracy in recognizing five sets of application-specific activities. Moreover, a comprehensive study is conducted to show AppListener is robust to a number of impact factors, such as distance, environment, and non-target connected devices. Practices of integrating AppListener into commercial IoT devices also demonstrate that it is easy to deploy. Finally, countermeasures are presented as the first step to defend against this novel attack.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,"Hot Pixels: Frequency, Power, and Temperature Attacks on GPUs and Arm SoCs",USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"The drive to create thinner, lighter, and more energy efficient devices has resulted in modern SoCs being forced to balance a delicate tradeoff between power consumption, heat dissipation, and execution speed (i.e., frequency). While beneficial, these DVFS mechanisms have also resulted in software-visible hybrid side-channels, which use software to probe analog properties of computing devices. Such hybrid attacks are an emerging threat that can bypass countermeasures for traditional microarchitectural side-channel attacks. Given the rise in popularity of both Arm SoCs and GPUs, in this paper we investigate the susceptibility of these devices to information leakage via power, temperature and frequency, as measured via internal sensors. We demonstrate that the sensor data observed correlates with both instructions executed and data processed, allowing us to mount software-visible hybrid side-channel attacks on these devices. To demonstrate the real-world impact of this issue, we present JavaScript-based pixel stealing and history sniffing attacks on Chrome and Safari, with all side channel countermeasures enabled. Finally, we also show website fingerprinting attacks, without any elevated privileges.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,Greenhouse: Single-Service Rehosting of Linux-Based Firmware Binaries in User-Space Emulation,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"As IoT devices grow more widespread, scaling current analysis techniques to match becomes an increasingly critical task. Part of this challenge involves not only rehosting the firmware of these embedded devices in an emulated environment, but to do so and discover real vulnerabilities. Current state-of-the-art approaches for rehosting must account for the discrepancies between emulated and physical devices, and thus generally focus on improving the emulation fidelity. However, this pursuit of fidelity ignores other potential solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel rehosting technique, user-space single-service rehosting, which emulates a single firmware service in user space. We study the rehosting process involved in hundreds of firmware samples to generalize a set of roadblocks that prevent emulation and create interventions to resolve them. Our prototype Greenhouse automatically rehosts 2,841 (39.7%) of our collected 7,140 firmware images from nine different vendors. Our approach sidesteps many of the challenges encountered by previous rehosting techniques and enables us to apply common vulnerability discovery techniques to our rehosted images such as user-space coverage-guided fuzzing. Using these techniques, we find 717 N-day vulnerabilities and 26 zero-day vulnerabilities on a subset of our rehosted firmware services.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,Remote Attacks on Speech Recognition Systems Using Sound from Power Supply,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Speech recognition (SR) systems are used on smartphones and speakers to make inquiries, compose emails, and initiate phone calls. However, they also impose a severe security risk. Researchers have demonstrated that the introduction of certain sounds can threaten the security of SR systems. Nonetheless, most of those methods require that the attacker approach within a short distance of the victim, thereby limiting the applicability of such schemes. Other researchers have attacked SR systems remotely using peripheral devices (e.g., lasers); however, those methods require line-of-sight access and an always-on speaker in the vicinity of the victim. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first-ever scheme, named SINGATTACK, in which SR systems are manipulated by human-like sounds generated in the switching mode power supply of the victim’s device. The fact that attack signals are transmitted via the power grid enables long-range attacks on existing SR systems. In experiments on ten SR systems, SINGATTACK achieved Mel-Cepstral Distortion of 7.8 from an attack initiated at a distance of 23m.",

ACM DL,conferencePaper,2023,Optical Cryptanalysis: Recovering Cryptographic Keys from Power LED Light Fluctuations,CCS - ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security,A*,"Although power LEDs have been integrated in various devices that perform cryptographic operations for decades, the cryptanalysis risk they pose has not yet been investigated. In this paper, we present optical cryptanalysis, a new form of cryptanalytic side-channel attack, in which secret keys are extracted by using a photodiode to measure the light emitted by a device's power LED and analyzing subtle fluctuations in the light intensity during cryptographic operations. We analyze the optical leakage of power LEDs of various consumer devices and the factors that affect the optical SNR. We then demonstrate end-to-end optical cryptanalytic attacks against a range of consumer devices (smartphone, smartcard, and Raspberry Pi, along with their USB peripherals) and recover secret keys (RSA, ECDSA, SIKE) from prior and recent versions of popular cryptographic libraries (GnuPG, Libgcrypt, PQCrypto-SIDH) from a maximum distance of 25 meters.",cryptanalysis; ecdsa; rsa; side-channel attack; sike
ACM DL,conferencePaper,2023,Exploration of Power Side-Channel Vulnerabilities in Quantum Computer Controllers,CCS - ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security,A*,"The rapidly growing interest in quantum computing also increases the importance of securing these computers from various physical attacks. Constantly increasing qubit counts and improvements to the fidelity of the quantum computers hold great promise for the ability of these computers to run novel algorithms with highly sensitive intellectual property. However, in today's cloud-based quantum computer setting, users lack physical control over the computers. Physical attacks, such as those perpetrated by malicious insiders in data centers, could be used to extract sensitive information about the circuits being executed on these computers. This work shows the first exploration and study of power-based side-channel attacks in quantum computers. The explored attacks could be used to recover information about the control pulses sent to these computers. By analyzing these control pulses, attackers can reverse-engineer the equivalent gate-level description of the circuits, and the algorithms being run, or data hard-coded into the circuits. This work introduces five new types of attacks, and evaluates them using control pulse information available from cloud-based quantum computers. This work demonstrates how and what circuits could be recovered, and then in turn how to defend from the newly demonstrated side-channel attacks on quantum computing systems.",power side-channel vulnerabilities; quantum computer controllers; quantum computers
ACM DL,conferencePaper,2023,Homomorphic Multiple Precision Multiplication for CKKS and Reduced Modulus Consumption,CCS - ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security,A*,"Homomorphic Encryption (HE) schemes such as BGV, BFV, and CKKS consume some ciphertext modulus for each multiplication. Bootstrapping (BTS) restores the modulus and allows homomorphic computation to continue, but it is time-consuming and requires a significant amount of modulus. For these reasons, decreasing modulus consumption is crucial topic for BGV, BFV and CKKS, on which numerous studies have been conducted.We propose a novel method, called Mult2, to perform ciphertext multiplication in the CKKS scheme with lower modulus consumption. Mult2 relies an a new decomposition of a ciphertext into a pair of ciphertexts that homomorphically performs a weak form of Euclidean division. It multiplies two ciphertexts in decomposed formats with homomorphic double precision multiplication, and its result approximately decrypts to the same value as does the ordinary CKKS multiplication. Mult2 can perform homomorphic multiplication by consuming almost half of the modulus.We extend it to Multt for any t≥ 2, which relies on the decomposition of a ciphertext into t components. All other CKKS operations can be equally performed on pair/tuple formats, leading to the double-CKKS (resp. tuple-CKKS) scheme enabling homomorphic double (resp. multiple) precision arithmetic.As a result, when the ciphertext modulus and dimension are fixed, the proposed algorithms enable the evaluation of deeper circuits without bootstrapping, or allow to reduce the number of bootstrappings required for the evaluation of the same circuits. Furthermore, they can be used to increase the precision without increasing the parameters. For example, Mult2 enables 8 sequential multiplications with 100 bit scaling factor with a ciphertext modulus of only 680 bits, which is impossible with the ordinary CKKS multiplication algorithm.",approximate multiplication; ckks scheme; fully homomorphic encryption; high precision; small parameters

Web of Science,conferencePaper,2022,SUPERVOICE: Text-Independent Speaker Verification Using Ultrasound Energy in Human Speech,AsiaCCS - Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security,A,"Voice-activated systems are integrated into a variety of desktop, mobile, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. However, voice spoofing attacks, such as impersonation and replay attacks, in which malicious attackers synthesize the voice of a victim or simply replay it, have brought growing security concerns. Existing speaker verification techniques distinguish individual speakers via the spectrographic features extracted from an audible frequency range of voice commands. However, they often have high error rates and/or long delays. In this paper, we explore a new direction of human voice research by scrutinizing the unique characteristics of human speech at the ultrasound frequency band. Our research indicates that the high-frequency ultrasound components (e.g. speech fricatives) from 20 to 48 kHz can significantly enhance the security and accuracy of speaker verification. We propose a speaker verification system, SuperVoice that uses a two-stream DNN architecture with a feature fusion mechanism to generate distinctive speaker models. To test the system, we create a speech dataset with 12 hours of audio (8,950 voice samples) from 127 participants. In addition, we create a second spoofed voice dataset to evaluate its security. In order to balance between controlled recordings and real-world applications, the audio recordings are collected from two quiet rooms by 8 different recording devices, including 7 smartphones and an ultrasound microphone. Our evaluation shows that SuperVoice achieves 0.58% equal error rate in the speaker verification task, which reduces the best equal error rate of the existing systems by 86.1%. SuperVoice only takes 120 ms for testing an incoming utterance, outperforming all existing speaker verification systems. Moreover, within 91 ms processing time, SuperVoice achieves 0% equal error rate in detecting replay attacks launched by 5 different loudspeakers. Finally, we demonstrate that SuperVoice can be used in retail smartphones by integrating an off-the-shelf ultrasound microphone.",Voice Authentication; Ultrasound; Speaker Verification

However, lack of consideration of communication delays and straggler nodes in conventional synchronous FL hinders their applications within the real-world. To level the playing field, we propose a novel semi-asynchronous FL solution on basis of a preset-cut-off time and a buffer system to mitigate the adverse effects of communication latency and stragglers. Furthermore, we leverage the use of a Deep Auto-encoder model for effective cyberattack detection. Experimental evaluations of our proposed framework on industrial control datasets validate superior attack detection while decreasing the adverse effects of communication latency and straggler nodes. Lastly, we notice a 30% improvement in the computation time in the presence of communication latency/straggler nodes, thus validating the robustness of our proposed method.",Cyberattack; Deep Learning; Federated Learning; Privacy by design; Anomaly Detection; Internet of Things (IoT); Smart Grid

However, the IoT landscape and its security implications are not yet fully understood. This paper seeks to shed light on this by focusing on a particular type of IoT devices, namely the ones using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Our contributions are two-fold: First, we present Ble-Guuide, a framework for performing mobile app-centric security issue identification. We exploit Universally Unique Identifiers ( UUIDs), which underpin data transmissions in BLE, to glean rich information regarding device functionality and the underlying security issues. We combine this with information from app descriptions and BLE libraries, to identify the corresponding security vulnerabilities in BLE devices and determine the security or privacy impact they could have depending on the device functionality. Second, we present a large-scale analysis of 17,243 free, BLE-enabled Android APKs, systematically crawled from the official Google Play store. By applying Ble-Guuide to this dataset, we uncover that more than 70% of these APKs contain at least one security vulnerability. We also obtain insights into the identified security vulnerabilities and their impact.",IoT Security; UUID; BLE; Android

The techniques include vertical correlation power analysis, horizontal in-depth correlation power analysis, online template attacks, and chosen-input simple power analysis. The implementations include the reference one, the one optimized using smladx, and three protected ones. Adversaries in this study can fully recover private keys with one single trace of short observation span, with few template traces from a fully controlled device similar to the target and no a priori power model, or sometimes even with the naked eye. The techniques target the constant-time generic polynomial multiplications in the product scanning method. Though in this work they focus on the decapsulation, they also work on the key generation and encapsulation of NTRU Prime.

Scopus,conferencePaper,2021,MIRACLE: MIcRo-ArChitectural Leakage Evaluation A study of micro-architectural power leakage across many devices,CHES - Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems,A,"In this paper, we describe an extensible experimental infrastructure for evaluating the micro-architectural leakage, based on power consumption, that stems from a physical device. Building on existing literature, we use it to systematically study 14 different devices, which span 4 different instruction set architectures and 4 different vendors. The study allows a characterisation of each device with respect to any leakage effects stemming from sources within the micro-architectural implementation. We use it, for example, to identify and document several novel leakage effects (e.g., due to speculative instruction execution), and scenarios where an assumption about leakage is non-portable between different yet compatible devices. Ours is the widest study of its kind we are aware of, and highlights a range of challenges with respect to 1) the design, implementation, and evaluation of, e.g., masking schemes, 2) construction of accurate leakage models, and 3) selection of suitable devices for experimental research. For example, in relation to 1), we cast further doubt on whether a given device upholds the assumptions required by a given masking scheme; in relation to 2), we conclude that (statistical or formal) device leakage models must include information about the micro-architecture being modelled; in relation to 3), we claim the near mono-culture of devices that dominates existing literature is insufficient to support general claims regarding leakage.

Scopus,conferencePaper,2021,VITI: A Tiny Self-Calibrating Sensor for Power-Variation Measurement in FPGAs,CHES - Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems,A,"On-chip sensors, built using reconfigurable logic resources in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), have been shown to sense variations in signal-propagation delay, supply voltage and power consumption. These sensors have been successfully used to deploy security attacks called Remote Power Analysis (RPA) Attacks on FPGAs. The sensors proposed thus far consume significant logic resources and some of them could be used to deploy power viruses. In this paper, a sensor (named VITI ) occupying a far smaller footprint than existing sensors is presented. VITI is a self-calibrating on-chip sensor design, constructed using adjustable delay ele-ments, flip-flops and LUT elements instead of combinational loops, bulky carry chains or latches. Self-calibration enables VITI the autonomous adaptation to differing situations (such as increased power consumption, temperature changes or placement of the sensor in faraway locations from the circuit under attack). The efficacy of VITI for power consumption measurement was evaluated using Remote Power Analysis (RPA) attacks and results demonstrate recovery of a full 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) key with only 20,000 power traces. Experiments demonstrate that VITI consumes 1/4th and 1/16th of the area compared to state-of-the-art sensors such as time to digital converters and ring oscillators for similar effectiveness. © 2022, Ruhr-University of Bochum.

The FO transformation has been widely used in actively securing KEMs from passively secure public key encryption (PKE), as it is employed in most of NIST post-quantum cryptography (PQC) candidates for KEM. The proposed attack exploits side-channel leakage during execution of a pseudorandom function (PRF) or pseudorandom number generator (PRG) in the re-encryption of KEM decapsulation as a plaintext-checking oracle that tells whether the PKE decryption result is equivalent to the reference plaintext. The generality and practicality of the plaintext-checking oracle allow the proposed attack to attain a full-key recovery of various KEMs when an active attack on the underlying PKE is known. This paper demonstrates that the proposed attack can be applied to most NIST PQC third-round KEM candidates, namely, Kyber, Saber, FrodoKEM, NTRU, NTRU Prime, HQC, BIKE, and SIKE (for BIKE, the proposed attack achieves a partial key recovery). The applicability to Classic McEliece is unclear because there is no known active attack on this cryptosystem. This paper also presents a side-channel distinguisher design based on deep learning (DL) for mounting the proposed attack on practical implementation without the use of a profiling device. The feasibility of the proposed attack is evaluated through experimental attacks on various PRF implementations (a SHAKE software, an AES software, an AES hardware, a bit-sliced masked AES software, and a masked AES hardware based on threshold implementation). Although it is difficult to implement the oracle using the leakage from the TI-based masked hardware, the success of the proposed attack against these implementations (even except for the masked hardware), which include masked software, confirms its practicality. © 2021, Ruhr-University of Bochum.

Scopus,conferencePaper,2021,Countermeasures against static power attacks – comparing exhaustive logic balancing and other protection schemes in 28 nm cmos –,CHES - Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems,A,"In recent years it has been demonstrated convincingly that the standby power of a CMOS chip reveals information about the internally stored and processed data. Thus, for adversaries who seek to extract secrets from cryptographic devices via side-channel analysis, the static power has become an attractive quantity to obtain. Most works have focused on the destructive side of this subject by demonstrating attacks. In this work, we examine potential solutions to protect circuits from silently leaking sensitive information during idle times. We focus on countermeasures that can be implemented using any common digital standard cell library and do not consider solutions that require full-custom or analog design flow. In particular, we evaluate and compare a set of five distinct standard-cell-based hiding countermeasures, including both, randomization and equalization techniques. We then combine the hiding countermeasures with state-of-the-art hardware masking in order to amplify the noise level and achieve a high resistance against attacks. An important part of our contribution is the proposal and evaluation of the first ever standard-cell-based balancing scheme which achieves perfect data-independence on paper, i.e., in absence of intra-die process variations and aging effects. We call our new countermeasure Exhaustive Logic Balancing (ELB). While this scheme, applied to a threshold im-plementation, provides the highest level of resistance in our experiments, it may not be the most cost effective option due to the significant resource overhead associated. All evaluated countermeasures and combinations thereof are applied to a serialized hardware implementation of the PRESENT block cipher and realized as cryptographic co-processors on a 28 nm CMOS ASIC prototype. Our experimental results are obtained through real-silicon measurements of a fabricated die of the ASIC in a temperature-controlled environment using a source measure unit (SMU). We believe that our elaborate comparison serves as a useful guideline for hardware designers to find a proper tradeoff between security and cost for almost any application. © 2021, Ruhr-University of Bochum.

DPA is applicable to many cryptographic primitives, including block ciphers, stream ciphers and even hash-based message authentication code (HMAC).

In this work, we generalise their methodology and combine with differential analysis, we called it differential analysis aided power attack (DAPA), to uncover more bit relations and take into account the linear or non-linear functions that feedback to the shift registers (i.e. LFSRs or NLFSRs). Next, we apply our DAPA on LR-Keymill, the improved version of Keymill designed to resist the aforementioned DPA, and breaks its 67.9-bit security claim with a 4-bit internal state guessing. We experimentally verified our analysis. In addition, we improve the previous DPA on Keymill by halving the amount of data resources needed for the attack.

While side-channel leakage originates in processor hardware, the dangerous consequences may only become apparent in the cryptographic software that runs on the processor. This contribution presents RootCanal, a methodology to explain the origin of side-channel leakage in a software program in terms of the underlying micro-architecture and system architecture. We simulate the hardware power consumption at the gate level and perform a non-specific test to identify the logic gates that contribute most side-channel leakage. Then, we back-annotate those findings to the related activities in the software. The resulting analysis can automatically point out non-trivial causes of side-channel leakages.

Scopus,conferencePaper,2022,A Power to Pulse Width Modulation Sensor for Remote Power Analysis Attacks,CHES - Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems,A,"Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) deployed on commercial cloud services are increasingly gaining popularity due to the cost and compute benefits offered by them. Recent studies have discovered security threats than can be launched remotely on FPGAs that share the logic fabric between trusted and untrusted parties, posing a danger to designs deployed on cloud FPGAs. With remote power analysis (RPA) attacks, an attacker aims to deduce secret information present on a remote FPGA by deploying an on-chip sensor on the FPGA logic fabric. Information captured with the on-chip sensor is transferred off the chip for analysis and existing on-chip sensors demand a significant amount of bandwidth for this task as a result of their wider output bit width. However, attackers are often left with the only option of using a covert communication channel and the bandwidth of such channels is generally limited. This paper proposes a novel area-efficient on-chip power sensor named PPWM that integrates a logic design outputting a pulse whose width is modulated by the power consumption of the FPGA. This pulse is used to clear a flip-flop selectively and asynchronously, and the single-bit output of the flip-flop is used to perform an RPA attack. This paper demonstrates the possibility of successfully recovering a 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) key within 16,000 power traces while consuming just 25% of the bandwidth when compared to the state of the art. Moreover, this paper assesses the threat posed by the proposed PPWM to remote FPGAs including those that are deployed on cloud services. © 2022, Ruhr-University of Bochum.

Scopus,conferencePaper,2022,The Hidden Parallelepiped Is Back Again: Power Analysis Attacks on Falcon,CHES - Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems,A,"Falcon is a very efficient and compact lattice-based signature finalist of the NIST’s Post-Quantum standardization campaign. This work assesses Falcon’s side-channel resistance by analyzing two vulnerabilities, namely the pre-image computation and the trapdoor sampling. The first attack is an improvement of Karabulut and Aysu (DAC 2021). It overcomes several difficulties inherent to the structure of the stored key like the Fourier representation and directly recovers the key with a limited number of traces and a reduced complexity. The main part of this paper is dedicated to our second attack: we show that a simple power analysis during the signature execution could provide the exact value of the output of a subroutine called the base sampler. This intermediate value does not directly lead to the secret and we had to adapt the so-called hidden parallelepiped attack initially introduced by Nguyen and Regev in Eurocrypt 2006 and reused by Ducas and Nguyen in Asiacrypt 2012. We extensively quantify the resources for our attacks and experimentally demonstrate them with Falcon’s reference implementation on the ELMO simulator (McCann, Oswald and Whitnall USENIX 2017) and on a ChipWhisperer Lite with STM32F3 target (ARM Cortex M4). These new attacks highlight the need for side-channel protection for one of the three finalists of NIST’s standardization campaign by pointing out the vulnerable parts and quantifying the resources of the attacks. © 2022, Ruhr-University of Bochum.

Scopus,conferencePaper,2023,RDS: FPGA Routing Delay Sensors for Effective Remote Power Analysis Attacks,CHES - Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems,A,"State-of-the-art sensors for measuring FPGA voltage fluctuations are time-to-digital converters (TDCs). They allow detecting voltage fluctuations in the order of a few nanoseconds. The key building component of a TDC is a delay line, typically implemented as a chain of fast carry propagation multiplexers. In FPGAs, the fast carry chains are constrained to dedicated logic and routing, and need to be routed strictly vertically. In this work, we present an alternative approach to designing on-chip voltage sensors, in which the FPGA routing resources replace the carry logic. We present three variants of what we name a routing delay sensor (RDS): one vertically constrained, one horizontally constrained, and one free of any constraints. We perform a thorough experimental evaluation on both the Sakura-X side-channel evaluation board and the Alveo U200 datacenter card, to evaluate the performance of the RDS sensors in the context of a remote power side-channel analysis attack. The results show that our best RDS implementation in most cases outperforms the TDC. On average, for breaking the full 128-bit key of an AES-128 cryptographic core, an adversary requires 35% fewer side-channel traces when using the RDS than when using the TDC. Besides making the attack more effective, given the absence of the placement and routing constraint, the RDS sensor is also easier to deploy. © 2023, Ruhr-University of Bochum.

In the experimental part of the paper, we demonstrate successful application of the attack both in software simulation and on an FPGA board using power consumption measurements. With as few as 30K traces measured on the FPGA board, we recover the secrets that allow for forging the HMAC-SHA-2 signature of any message in 3% of the cases — while with 275K traces the success rate reaches 100%. This means that any implementation of HMAC-SHA-2, even in pure parallel hardware, is vulnerable to side-channel attacks, unless it is adequately protected. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published full-fledged attack on pure hardware implementations of HMAC-SHA-2, which does not require a profiling stage. © 2023, Ruhr-University of Bochum.

Web of Science,conferencePaper,2021,On the Power of Expansion: More Efficient Constructions in the Random Probing Model,EUROCRYPT - Annual International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques,A,"The random probing model is a leakage model in which each wire of a circuit leaks with a given probability p. This model enjoys practical relevance thanks to a reduction to the noisy leakage model, which is admitted as the right formalization for power and electromagnetic side-channel attacks. In addition, the random probing model is much more convenient than the noisy leakage model to prove the security of masking schemes. In a recent work, Ananth, Ishai, and Sahai (CRYPTO 2018) introduce a nice expansion strategy to construct random probing secure circuits. Their construction tolerates a leakage probability of 2(-26), which is the first quantified achievable leakage probability in the random probing model. In a follow-up work, Belaid, Coron, Prouff, Rivain, and Taleb (CRYPTO 2020) generalize their idea and put forward a complete and practical framework to generate random probing secure circuits. The so-called expanding compiler can bootstrap simple base gadgets as long as they satisfy a new security notion called random probing expandability (RPE). They further provide an instantiation of the framework which tolerates a 2(-8) leakage probability in complexity O(kappa(7.5)) where. denotes the security parameter. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the RPE security notion. We exhibit the first upper bounds for the main parameter of a RPE gadget, which is known as the amplification order. We further show that the RPE notion can be made tighter and we exhibit strong connections between RPE and the strong non-interference (SNI) composition notion. We then introduce the first generic constructions of gadgets achieving RPE for any number of shares and with nearly optimal amplification orders and provide an asymptotic analysis of such constructions. Last but not least, we introduce new concrete constructions of small gadgets achieving maximal amplification orders. This allows us to obtain much more efficient instantiations of the expanding compiler: we obtain a complexity of O(kappa(3.9)) for a slightly better leakage probability, as well as O(kappa(3.2)) for a slightly lower leakage probability.",Random probing model; Masking; Side-channel security
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Legendre PRF (Multiple) Key Attacks and the Power of Preprocessing,CSF - IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium,A,"Due to its amazing speed and multiplicative properties the Legendre PRF recently finds widespread applications e.g. in Ethereum 2.0, multiparty computation and in the quantum-secure signature proposal LegRoast. However, its security is not yet extensively studied. The Legendre PRF computes for a key $k$ on input $x$ the Legendre symbol $L_{k}(x)=(\frac{x+k}{p})$ in some finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p}$. As standard notion, PRF security is analysed by giving an attacker oracle access to $L_{k}(\cdot)$. Khovratovich's collision-based algorithm recovers $k$ using $L_{k}(\cdot)$ in time $\sqrt{p}$ with constant memory. It is a major open problem whether this birthday-bound complexity can be beaten. We show a somewhat surprising wide-ranging analogy between the discrete logarithm problem and Legendre symbol computations. This analogy allows us to adapt various algorithmic ideas from the discrete logarithm setting. More precisely, we present a small memory multiple-key attack on $m$ Legendre keys $k_{1}, \ldots, k_{m}$ in time $\sqrt{mp}$, i.e. with amortized cost $\sqrt{p/m}$ per key. This multiple-key attack might be of interest in the Ethereum context, since recovering many keys simultaneously maximizes an attacker's profit. Moreover, we show that the Legendre PRF admits precomputation attacks, where the precomputation depends on the public $p$ only - and not on a key $k$. Namely, an attacker may compute e.g. in precomputation time $p^{\frac{2}{3}}$ a hint of size $p^{\frac{1}{3}}$. On receiving access to $L_{k}(\cdot)$ in an online phase, the attacker then uses the hint to recover the desired key $k$ in time only $p^{\frac{1}{3}}$. Thus, the attacker's online complexity again beats the birthday-bound. In addition, our precomputation attack can also be combined with our multiple-key attack. We explicitly give various tradeoffs between precomputation and online phase. E.g. for attacking $m$ keys one may spend time $mp^{\frac{2}{3}}$ in the precomputation phase for constructing a hint of size $m^{2}p^{\frac{1}{3}}$. In an online phase, one then finds all $m$ keys in total time only $p^{\frac{1}{3}}$. Precomputation attacks might again be interesting in the Ethereum 2.0 context, where keys are frequently changed such that a heavy key-independent precomputation pays off.",public key cryptography / Preprocessing;Legendre PRF;Ethereum 2.0
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Securing Optimized Code Against Power Side Channels,CSF - IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium,A,"Side-channel attacks impose a serious threat to cryptographic algorithms, including widely employed ones, such as AES and RSA. These attacks take advantage of the algorithm implementation in hardware or software to extract secret information via side channels. Software masking is a mitigation approach against power side-channel attacks aiming at hiding the secret-revealing dependencies from the power footprint of a vulnerable implementation. However, this type of software mitigation often depends on general-purpose compilers, which do not preserve non-functional properties. Moreover, microarchitectural features, such as the memory bus and register reuse, may also leak secret information. These abstractions are not visible at the high-level implementation of the program. Instead, they are decided at compile time. To remedy these problems, security engineers often sacrifice code efficiency by turning off compiler optimization and/or performing local, post-compilation transformations. This paper proposes Secure by Construction Code Generation (SecCG), a constraint-based compiler approach that generates optimized yet protected against power side channels code. SecCG controls the quality of the mitigated program by efficiently searching the best possible low-level implementation according to a processor cost model. In our experiments with twelve masked cryptographic functions up to 100 lines of code on Mips32 and ARM Thumb, SecCG speeds up the generated code from 77% to 6.6 times compared to non-optimized secure code with an overhead of up to 13% compared to non-secure optimized code at the expense of a high compilation cost. For security and compiler researchers, this paper proposes a formal model to generate power side channel free low-level code. For software engineers, SecCG provides a practical approach to optimize performance critical and vulnerable cryptographic implementations that preserve security properties against power side channels.",compilation;power side-channel attacks;code optimization;software masking;constraint programming

The IoT malware attacks are usually composed of three stages: intrusion, infection and monetization. Existing approaches for IoT malware detection cannot effectively identify the executed malicious activities at intrusion and infection stages, and thus cannot help stop potential attacks timely. In this paper, we present DeepPower, a non-intrusive approach to infer malicious activities of IoT malware via analyzing power side-channel signals using deep learning. DeepPower first filters raw power signals of IoT devices to obtain suspicious signals, and then performs a fine-grained analysis on these signals to infer corresponding executed activities inside the devices. DeepPower determines whether there exists an ongoing malware infection by conducting a correlation analysis on these identified activities.

It is widely used in organizations for configuration management and task automation but is also increasingly used for launching cyber attacks against organizations, mainly because it is pre-installed on Windows machines and exposes strong functionality that may be leveraged by attackers. This makes the problem of detecting malicious PowerShell code both urgent and challenging. Microsoft's Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI), built into Windows 10, allows defending systems to scan all the code passed to scripting engines such as PowerShell prior to its execution. In this work, we conduct the first study of malicious PowerShell code detection using the information made available by AMSI. We present several novel deep-learning based detectors of malicious PowerShell code that employ pretrained contextual embeddings of words from the PowerShell ""language"". A contextual word embedding is able to project semantically-similar words to proximate vectors in the embedding space. A known problem in the cybersecurity domain is that labeled data is relatively scarce, in comparison with unlabeled data, making it difficult to devise effective supervised detection of malicious activity of many types. This is also the case with PowerShell code. Our work shows that this problem can be mitigated by learning a pretrained contextual embedding based on unlabeled data. We trained and evaluated our models using real-world data, collected using AMSI. The contextual embedding was learnt using a large corpus of unlabeled PowerShell scripts and modules collected from public repositories. Our performance analysis establishes that the use of unlabeled data for the embedding significantly improved the performance of our detectors. Our best-performing model uses an architecture that enables the processing of textual signals from both the character and token levels and obtains a true-positive rate of nearly 90% while maintaining a low false-positive rate of less than 0.1%.",cybersecurity; neural networks; powershell; contextual embedding

To understand what drives Bitcoin’s energy use and emissions however, one must understand four key concepts: how Bitcoin works and incentivises its miners, the nature of competition in the mining industry, the nature of mining hardware and innovation, and importantly, international energy and electricity markets and the differences between them. This paper will provide a thorough explanation of these concepts, as well as provide commentary on Bitcoin’s current state, and what the Bitcoin Mining Industry may potentially look like towards the end of the decade. © 2023, International Financial Cryptography Association.",Bitcoin; Emissions; Energy; Perfect Competition
Scopus,conferencePaper,2023,Improved Power Analysis Attacks on Falcon,EUROCRYPT - Annual International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques,A,"Falcon is one of the three post-quantum signature schemes selected for standardization by NIST. Due to its low bandwidth and high efficiency, Falcon is seen as an attractive option for quantum-safe embedded systems. In this work, we study Falcon’s side-channel resistance by analysing its Gaussian samplers. Our results are mainly twofold. The first result is an improved key recovery exploiting the leakage within the base sampler investigated by Guerreau et al. (CHES 2022). Instead of resorting to the fourth moment as in former parallelepiped-learning attacks, we work with the second order statistics covariance and use its spectral decomposition to recover the secret information. Our approach substantially reduces the requirement for measurements and computation resources: 220000 traces is sufficient to recover the secret key of Falcon-512 within half an hour with a probability of ≈ 25 %. As a comparison, even with 10 6 traces, the former attack still needs about 1000 h hours CPU time of lattice reduction for a full key recovery. In addition, our approach is robust to inaccurate leakage classification, which is another advantage over parallelepiped-learning attacks. Our second result is a practical power analysis targeting the integer Gaussian sampler of Falcon. The analysis relies on the leakage of random sign flip within the integer Gaussian sampling. This leakage was exposed in 2018 by Kim and Hong, but it is not considered in Falcon’s implementation and unexploited for side-channel analysis until now. We identify the leakage within the reference implementation of Falcon on an ARM Cortex-M4 STM32F407IGT6 microprocessor. We also show that this single bit of leakage is in effect enough for practical key recovery: with 170000 traces one can fully recover the key of Falcon-512 within half an hour. Furthermore, combining the sign leakage and the aforementioned leakage, one can recover the key with only 45000 signature measurements in a short time. As a by-product, we also extend our power analysis to Mitaka which is a recent variant of Falcon. The same leakages exist within the integer Gaussian samplers of Mitaka, and they can also be used to mount key recovery attacks. Nevertheless, the key recovery in Mitaka requires much more traces than it does in Falcon, due to their different lattice Gaussian samplers. © 2023, International Association for Cryptologic Research.",
Scopus,conferencePaper,2021,Encryption is futile: Reconstructing 3D-printed models using the power side-channel,"RAID - The International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions and Defenses",A,"Outsourced Additive Manufacturing (AM) exposes sensitive design data to external malicious actors. Even with end-to-end encryption between the design owner and 3D-printer, side-channel attacks can be used to bypass cyber-security measures and obtain the underlying design. In this paper, we develop a method based on the power side-channel that enables accurate design reconstruction in the face of full encryption measures without any prior knowledge of the design. Our evaluation on a Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D Printer has shown 99 % accuracy in reconstruction, a significant improvement on the state of the art. This approach demonstrates the futility of pure cyber-security measures applied to Additive Manufacturing. © 2021 ACM.",3D Printing; Additive Manufacturing; Intellectual Property Theft; IP Theft.; Side-Channel Attack
Scopus,conferencePaper,2020,The Power of the Hybrid Model for Mean Estimation,PETS - International Symposium on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,A,"We explore the power of the hybrid model of diﬀerential privacy (DP), in which some users desire the guarantees of the local model of DP and others are content with receiving the trusted-curator model guarantees. In particular, we study the utility of hybrid model estimators that compute the mean of arbitrary realvalued distributions with bounded support. When the curator knows the distribution’s variance, we design a hybrid estimator that, for realistic datasets and parameter settings, achieves a constant factor improvement over natural baselines. We then analytically characterize how the estimator’s utility is parameterized by the problem setting and parameter choices. When the distribution’s variance is unknown, we design a heuristic hybrid estimator and analyze how it compares to the baselines. We ﬁnd that it often performs better than the baselines, and sometimes almost as well as the known-variance estimator. We then answer the question of how our estimator’s utility is aﬀected when users’ data are not drawn from the same distribution, but rather from distributions dependent on their trust model preference. Concretely, we examine the implications of the two groups’ distributions diverging and show that in some cases, our estimators maintain fairly high utility. We then demonstrate how our hybrid estimator can be incorporated as a sub-component in more complex, higher-dimensional applications. Finally, we propose a new privacy ampliﬁcation notion for the hybrid model that emerges due to interaction between the groups, and derive corresponding ampliﬁcation results for our hybrid estimators.",
Scopus,conferencePaper,2020,Energy-Efficient Dummy Traffic Generation for Home Automation Systems,PETS - International Symposium on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,A,"Home and Building Automation Systems are becoming more and more popular these days. While they increase the comfort of living, they may also leak private information such as user presence to passive observers. In this paper we investigate approaches for the generation of dummy traﬃc in Home Automation Systems (HASs). We discuss fundamental requirements and their impact as well as two concrete dummy traﬃc generation algorithms. We measure the impact of ConstantRate Dummy Traﬃc (CRDT) on the responsiveness and energy eﬃciency of Home Automation Systems. As an alternative, we present the Naive Exponential Dummies (NED) generation scheme in which the balance between privacy guarantees and energy eﬃciency can be arbitrarily moved. We formally prove its privacy guarantees and evaluate it against realistic sample data.",
