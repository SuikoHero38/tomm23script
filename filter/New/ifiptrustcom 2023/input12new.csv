IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Representation-enhanced APT Detection Using Contrastive Learning,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are low-and-slow attack patterns and difficult to detect due to their strong concealment. Recently, provenance-based method demonstrates promising prospect in APT detection. However, existing approaches suffer from following several limitations. First, rule-based models heavily rely on domain-specific knowledges and sophisticated matching mechanism from rules to system logs. Second, current anomaly-based techniques require attack-free data to train model and hard to acquire fine-grained detection results to locate attack events. An important reason for undermining the detection capacity of model is the notorious dependency explosion problem and data imbalance problem. Both of problems make the vector representations of benign events and attack events similar, therefore, the model can not differentiate them well. In this paper, we propose DeepDist, which can enhance the entity vector representation by contrastive learning. In this way, we force the projection of benign and attack entities into different feature regions to improve the detection ability of the model. Then we correlate these detected entities to constitute attack events. During our evaluation against thirteen real APT attack scenarios of two datasets, DeepDist shows the detection results with high accuracy.",APT detection;provenance graph;contrastive learning
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,APM: An Attack Path-based Method for APT Attack Detection on Few-Shot Learning,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Advanced persistent threat (APT) attack leverages various intelligence-gathering techniques to obtain sensitive and critical information, imposing increasing threats to modern software enterprises. However, due to the persistent presence of APT attacks, it is difficult to effectively analyze a large amount of audit data for detecting such attacks, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This limitation hinders security operation centers (SOC) from promptly handling APT attacks. In this paper, we propose an attack path-based method (APM) for APT attack detection on few-shot learning. Specifically, APM first identifies candidate malicious entities from the provenance graph, contributing to the completion of the missing attack paths. Secondly, we propose a systematic method to exploit potential attack behaviors in the attack path based on the identified candidate malicious entities. We evaluate APM through five APT attacks in realistic environments. Compared to existing baselines, the precision, recall, and F1-score of APM for attack detection increased by 0.28%, 1.64%, and 1.13%, respectively. The results show that our proposal can outperform baseline approaches and effectively detect APT attacks based on few-shot learning.",attack detection;attack path;provenance graph;few-shot learning
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Class-Targeted Poisoning Attacks against DNNs,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"In recent years, the emergence of targeted cleanlabel poisoning attacks, which maliciously influence the training data without controlling over the labeling process to manipulate the behavior of the predictive model, is shown to be crucial threats to compromise deep learning systems. Prior targeted clean-label poisoning attacks have been demonstrated to target only one sample at a time, which is not always applicable in restricted real-world situations. In this paper, we explore targeted clean-label poisoning attacks on a per-class basis, which refers to misclassify samples from a victim class to the desired class while maintaining the classification accuracy of samples on other classes in multi-class classification tasks. To achieve this, we present the first class-targeted clean-label poisoning attack, called CTCL, which firsts craft clean label poisons along with multiple directions in the target feature space and enhance the attacking capability of poisons by reducing their the feature information of the target class. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed CTCL on various deep neural network models. The experiment results demonstrate that our attack is effective, with the attacking success rate over 80% compared to the other two baseline attacks on average, while the detection accuracy of state-of-the-art defenses is lower than 65% illustrating that CTCL can escape the detection of existing defenses readily.",Poisoning attack;class-targeted attack;clean-label attack;deep neural networks;transfer learning
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,EzBoost: Fast And Secure Vertical Federated Tree Boosting Framework via EzPC,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent methodology for collaboratively training machine learning models among multiple participants while alleviating data privacy leakage through data localization. However, recent studies have shown that the transferred intermediate parameters still contain sensitive information that needs to be further protected. More-over, real-world institutions often possess diverse data attributes, necessitating the adoption of Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) for cooperative learning tasks. Existing researches in VFL have proposed some frameworks with privacy-preservation functionality, yet they suffer from high participant overhead or low model accuracy, etc. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose EzBoost, a fast and secure vertical federated tree boosting framework built upon XGBoost. Specifically, we leverages the efficient Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) framework, EzPC, to facilitate the design and implementation of EzBoost. By carefully designing our framework with two non-collusive servers for secure two-party computation, EzBoost significantly accelerates the runtime of model training and querying at most 20Ã—, and reduces the participant overheads at most 300Ã—. In addition, we identify a potential privacy leakage problem in recent researches and propose a more robust solution for addressing it. Through comprehensive security analysis and comparative experiments with existing approaches, we demonstrate that EzBoost achieves stronger privacy-preservation, higher accuracy and higher efficiency simultaneously.",Vertical federated learning;Privacy-preserving;Tree boosting;Efficiency;Dual-servers
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Neighborhood Matching Entity Alignment Model for Vulnerability Knowledge Graphs,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Entity alignment aims to match identical entities in different knowledge graphs (KGs). In recent years, entity alignment methods for encyclopedic KGs have achieved significant effectiveness. However, the characteristics of KGs of some specific domains differs from encyclopedic KGs, so that encyclopedic entity alignment methods do not perform well in domain KGs. Vulnerability KGs are a typical type of domain KG characterized by a large number of entities and limited structural variations, but strong heterogeneity across different graphs. The neighborhood matching-based entity alignment methods are effective on vulnerability KGs. However, previous neighborhood matching methods have primarily focused on aligning neighborhoods where both entities and relations are aligned simultaneously, neglecting the neighborhoods where only entities are aligned. Vulnerability KGs typically contain a large number of entities but have a limited types of relations. As a result, each relation often connects a significant number of entities. Incorrect matching of relations can potentially result in incorrect matching of all connected entities, leading to severe error propagation.In this paper, we propose a neighborhood matching based method VNM, for entity alignment in vulnerability KGs. VNM considers two layers of neighborhood, that is, the neighborhood that entities and relations both align and the neighborhood that only entities align. Our method not only mitigates the error propagation caused by incorrect relation matching but also leverages richer neighborhood information. Additionally, inspired by the phenomenon of semantic translation in word embeddings, we introduce a regularizer for semantic embedding of one-to-many and many-to-one relations in vulnerability KGs. Experimental results on four real-world vulnerability datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of performance.",vulnerability knowledge graph;entity alignment;neighborhood matching
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,The Dynamic Paradox: How Layer-skipping DNNs Amplify Cache Side-Channel Leakages,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Traditional neural networks are static: their network structure and parameters remain fixed regardless of the input samples after the networks are trained. In contrast, dynamic neural networks are capable of dynamically adapting their structures and parameters when processing different input samples, e.g., with early exiting and layer skipping, to achieve more efficient use of resources and more effective feature representation. These capabilities make dynamic neural networks a promising area of development for deep learning, with the potential to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of neural network models.Previous research has demonstrated that the search space of static neural network structures can be significantly reduced by analyzing cache access traces. To date, the side channel risks associated with dynamic neural networks remain unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on the side-channel leakages of dynamic neural networks which are used to infer the network structure. We conduct both theoretical and experimental validation on a typical dynamic Layer-skipping DNNs structure, SkipNet, and show that the adaptive nature of dynamic DNNs leads to greater side-channel information leakage compared to traditional neural network structures. Specifically, our findings reveal that the network structure space of dynamic DNNs can be significantly reduced, from 36608057 Ã— 212 Ã— (264 âˆ’ 1)2 to 11286.",Deep Neural Network;Hyper-parameters Stealing Attack;Cache Side-channel Attack
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Advanced Machine-Learning Technologies for Coronary Artery Disease Prediction Using Heterogeneous Data,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Epidemiological studies have played an important role in explaining the risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and identifying opportunities for prevention. Early CVD intervention can prevent the progression of these diseases and effectively lower the mortality rate. In particular, using coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores has been proven to enhance the prediction of coronary heart disease events. Thus, the early prediction of high-risk CAC allows individuals to prevent coronary heart disease (CHD) from progressing to extreme symptoms and illnesses. The process of identifying and using various predictors to predict CAC has received increasing attention, which has helped clinicians and patients make informed decisions. In this discipline, traditional methods rely on statistical approaches to calculate the effects of clinical and demographic factors on CAC score prediction, enabling the identification of relevant features. However, with the advancement of machine learning (ML) techniques, it is now possible to train CAC models that offer highly accurate and stable predictions. This research investigates the application of non-parametric methods to identify and present non-linear relationships within cardiovascular disease datasets derived from the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Saudi Arabia, without assuming normal distributions. Furthermore, we will focus on efficient feature extraction to handle the dataset effectively. Additionally, we will explore the utility of regularised regression for predicting CAC scores.",cardiovascular diseases;coronary artery calcium;machine learning;correlation analysis;feature selection;feature extraction
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Learning in the Dark: Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning using Function Approximation,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Over the past few years, a tremendous growth of machine learning was brought about by a significant increase in adoption and implementation of cloud-based services. As a result, various solutions have been proposed in which the machine learning models run on a remote cloud provider and not locally on a userâ€™s machine. However, when such a model is deployed on an untrusted cloud provider, it is of vital importance that the usersâ€™ privacy is preserved. To this end, we propose Learning in the Dark â€“ a hybrid machine learning model in which the training phase occurs in plaintext data, but the classification of the usersâ€™ inputs is performed directly on homomorphically encrypted ciphertexts. To make our construction compatible with homomorphic encryption, we approximate the ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions using low-degree Chebyshev polynomials. This allowed us to build Learning in the Dark â€“ a privacy-preserving machine learning model that can classify encrypted images with high accuracy. Learning in the Dark preserves usersâ€™ privacy since it is capable of performing high accuracy predictions by performing computations directly on encrypted data. In addition to that, the output of Learning in the Dark is generated in a blind and therefore privacy-preserving way by utilizing the properties of homomorphic encryption.",Activation Function;Homomorphic Encryption;Neural Networks;Polynomial Approximation;Privacy
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Undermining License Plate Recognition: A Data Poisoning Attack,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"With the development of computer vision, License Plate Recognition (LPR) systems are widely employed in various applications, including traffic management and intelligent transportation. However, recent studies have shown that these systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which significantly undermine their accuracy and reliability. Existing works typically fall into evasion attacks and model poisoning attacks, which often lack feasibility and stealthiness. In contrast, data poisoning attacks have the advantage of being more practical and effective in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel data poisoning attack against LPR systems, which leverages gradient matching to generate poison samples that can mislead the recognition module of the systems. Notably, we focus on a challenging scenario, where we control only a small fraction of training data and attack a model trained from scratch without being perceptible. Moreover, we conduct experiments to validate our attack on the benchmark dataset CCPD2019 and demonstrate that our attack achieved outstanding performance by manipulating only 1% of the training data with perturbations less than 8 pixels in â„“âˆž-norm. Our work highlights the potential vulnerabilities of LPR systems and encourages research into more trustworthy systems.",data poisoning attack;license plate recognition;gradient matching
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Reducing Model Memorization to Mitigate Membership Inference Attacks,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Given a machine learning model and a record, membership inference attacks determine whether this record was used as part of the modelâ€™s training dataset. This can raise privacy issues. There is a desideratum to provide robust mitigation techniques against this attack that will not affect utility. One of the state-of-the-art frameworks in this area is SELENA, which has two phases: Split-AI and Self-Distillation to train a protected model. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to the Split-AI phase, which tries to weaken the membership inference by using the Jacobian matrix norm and entropy. We experimentally demonstrate that our approach can decrease the memorization of the machine-learning model for three datasets: Purchase100, CIFAR-10, and SVHN, more than SELENA in the same range of utility in a setting in which we do not know any member of the training data.",Machine Learning;Membership Inference Attacks;Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning;Knowledge Transfer;Jacobian Matrix;Entropy
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Towards Dynamic Backdoor Attacks against LiDAR Semantic Segmentation in Autonomous Driving,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"LiDAR perception is widely deployed in high-level autonomous vehicles (AVs) to gain accurate information about the driving environment, where 3D semantic segmentation plays a critical role as it can provide more fine-grained scene understanding than other tasks. The mainstream LiDAR perception systems mainly adopt deep neural networks (DNNs) to achieve good performance. However, densely annotating LiDAR point clouds and training complex LiDAR segmentation models are time-consuming and resource-intensive. It is common for ordinary self-driving developers to outsource the data annotation or model training task to third-party platforms, which could inevitably expose a natural attack injection point. In this paper, we propose BadLiSeg, the first work to investigate backdoor attacks against LiDAR semantic segmentation. Specifically, we present a general attack strategy based on which the attacker can inject a dynamic backdoor into the victim model by constructing a trigger pattern pool and a location pool. Afterward, the attacker can choose a common physical object (e.g., drone and traffic sign) as the trigger and place it around an arbitrary location in a selected area to easily fool the backdoored LiDAR segmentation model. Our extensive experiments on five representative segmentation models and one public dataset demonstrate that BadLiSeg can not only achieve a high attack success rate but also maintain the normal segmentation performance of the backdoored model. We further show the effectiveness of BadLiSeg on some practical attack scenarios collected from a high-fidelity simulator.",backdoor attack;LiDAR semantic segmentation
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,BadLiDet: A Simple Backdoor Attack against LiDAR Object Detection in Autonomous Driving,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) widely deploy LiDAR-based 3D object detection to accurately perceive and understand the surrounding environment. The mainstream LiDAR detection systems primarily adopt deep neural networks (DNNs) to achieve satisfactory performance.

A common practice for some individual developers and self-driving companies is to outsource data annotation or model training tasks to third-party platforms, which could expose a natural attack injection point. In this paper, we propose BadLiDet, a simple yet effective backdoor attack against LiDAR object detection in autonomous driving. Specifically, we present a model-agnostic attack strategy that enables an attacker to inject a shape-independent backdoor into the victim model by poisoning its training data. Afterward, the attacker can choose an ordinary object in different shapes as the trigger and place it around a specific location to easily deceive the LiDAR detection system. Our extensive experiments on five representative models and a public dataset demonstrate that BadLiDet can achieve a high attack success rate while preserving the utility of victim models. We further show the effectiveness of BadLiDet on the continuous attack scenario collected from a high-fidelity simulator. Moreover, the end-to-end simulation evaluation on an open-source self-driving platform shows that BadLiDet can cause a 100% vehicle collision rate.",backdoor attack;LiDAR object detection
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Safety or Not? A Comparative Study for Deep Learning Apps on Smartphones,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Recent years have witnessed an astonishing explosion in the evolution of mobile applications powered by deep learning (DL) technologies. Considering that inference of DL models in the cloud requires transferring user data to server, which is prone to the risk of user privacy leakage, many developers choose to deploy the models on local devices for executing the inference process. However, this also raises a number of other security issues, such as adversarial attacks, model stealing attacks, etc. To explore the security issues that exist in deep learning applications (DL apps), we conducted the first comprehensive comparative study of the top 200 apps in each category on Google Play. We built DLApplnspector, a vulnerability detection tool that combines dynamic and static analysis methods for dissecting apps, which helped us automate our empirical study on real-world mobile DL apps. First, we identify DL apps and extract their models by using DL Checker. Subsequently, Static Scoper is provided to detect encryption and reusability of DL models. Finally, within Dynamic Scoper, we use reverse engineering techniques on the network traffic to parse out the packets and collect side-channel information during application runtime. Our research shows that the majority of developers prefer to use open-source models, with almost 92% of models successfully parsed. This suggests that most models are unprotected. DL apps are more likely to upload user behaviour and collect private data than Non-DL apps. We provide security recommendations for developers and users to address the issues discovered.",Mobile Security;On-device Model;DL Applications;Privacy;Android

So far, there has been little attention paid to solutions for protecting the privacy of new datasets. In our work, we explored a object detection solution on the WIDER FACE dataset by anonymizing the dataset using face synthesis and enhancing the WIDER FACE dataset by balancing facial features along the dimensions of gender and skin color. Using both the original dataset and our enhanced dataset to train the target detection model, our target detection results show that our model can maintain detection performance while preserving privacy and partially balancing bias.",Face Detection;Privacy Protection;Machine Vision
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,FINDER: A Simple and Effective Defender against Unnoticeable Graph Injection Attacks,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have various applications in real-life scenarios. However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially Graph Injection Attacks (GIAs). The flexible and high-risk GIAs pose a significant threat by injecting malicious nodes into the graph. Regrettably, defense strategies to resist GIAs are still scarce. The current defenders lack comprehensive strategies that can effectively resist a wide range of injection techniques. Particularly, when confronted with highly unnoticeable GIAs, the performance of these defenses is significantly diminished. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective GIA defense method named Faithful INjection DefendER (FINDER). FINDER evaluates the impact of the nodes on their neighbors in the context of message aggregation to identify the potential injected nodes in the graph. By blocking identified injected nodes from interacting with the benign nodes, FINDER prevents the further propagation of misinformation and the spread of adversarial influence throughout the graph. Through extensive experiments conducted on three benchmarks, FINDER demonstrates remarkable performance in accurately identifying injected nodes and defending various GIAs.",Graph Neural Networks;Adversarial Attacks;Robustness;Node Classification
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,FlowBERT: An Encrypted Traffic Classification Model Based on Transformers Using Flow Sequence,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"With the widespread application of network traffic encryption, traffic identification has become increasingly critical. As the types of encryption protocols continue to grow, identifying encrypted traffic with limited training samples has become more challenging. In recent years, pre-training models have been extensively applied in natural language processing due to their ability to utilize a large amount of unlabeled data effectively. However, when applied to encrypted traffic identification, these methods lack sufficient information extraction from encrypted network traffic, resulting in the loss of some essential features and negatively impacting the recognition performance of such approaches. Therefore, we proposed an encrypted traffic classification model based on a Transformer named FlowBERT. In FlowBERT, the semantic features of the traffic can be learned from two dimensions: payload and packet length sequence in large-scale, unlabeled encrypted traffic scenarios. Length sequences are encoded to extract traffic sequence features efficiently, enabling the model to learn the contextual semantic relationships within the sequences. Simultaneously, the pre-training process is improved by balancing data samples, enhancing the performance of the pre-training model. We validated the performance of this method on both classic encrypted traffic classification datasets and the novel network protocol DoH dataset. We concluded that our approach demonstrates robustness and superior recognition performance compared to similar methods.",encrypted traffic classification;transformers;deep learning

While several methods have been proposed for generating physical adversarial examples, they often suffer from a critical flaw -conspicuous and easily detectable patterns by humans, limiting their real-world effectiveness. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an innovative approach termed ""dual adversarial camouflage"" (DAC) that generates natural adversarial camouflage in the physical world. Our DAC method leverages natural styles to hide attacks effectively. The process involves a two-stage training process. In the first stage, we learn the style features from style images. Building on this, the second stage optimizes the camouflage obtained in the first stage by minimizing the target detection score, thus significantly enhancing the attack performance. Experiment results show that the adversarial camouflage generated by our method has high naturalness and can effectively deceive object detectors. In practical tests, the attack success rate of our adversarial camouflage in both the digital and physical worlds is impressive, achieving 96.9% and 80% respectively. This showcases the real-world potential and robustness of our DAC method in evading detection.",Adversarial Examples;Natural Style;Adversarial Camouflage;Object Detectors;Adversarial Attack

However, this distributed learning paradigm is susceptible to adversarial attacks, particularly model poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject malicious model updates to compromise the integrity of the global model. In this paper, we investigate the impact of randomness on model poisoning attacks in federated networks, where the server employs two aggregation rules, Krum and Trimmed Mean, randomly in each federated round. We present three distinct adversaries: one targeting Krum throughout the entire learning process, another targeting Trimmed Mean entirely, and a third adversary employing a randomized strategy between Krum and Trimmed Mean for each round. Our objective is to evaluate their performance in reducing the overall accuracy of the federated network. We propose novel techniques to craft poisoned models and explore the efficacy of these attacks by exploiting the aggregation rules. We evaluated our proposed methods on Fashion-MNIST dataset.

Even though FL offers a certain level of privacy by design, recent works show that FL is vulnerable to numerous privacy attacks. One of the key features of FL is the continuous training of FL models over many cycles through time. Observing changes in FL models over time can lead to inferring information on changes to private and sensitive data used in the FL process. However, this potential leakage of private information is not yet investigated significantly. Therefore, this paper introduces a new form of inference-based privacy attacks called FL Time Inference Attacks (FL-TIA). These attacks can reveal private time-related properties such as the presence or absence of a sensitive feature over time and if it is periodical. We consider two forms of such FL-TIA: i.e. identifying changes in membership of target data records over training rounds and detecting significant events in clients over time by observing differences in FL models. We use the network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) as a use case to demonstrate the impact of our attack. We propose a continuous updating attack model method for membership variation detection by sustaining the accuracy of the attack.

The parameters from each endpoint are iteratively aggregated through federated learning to improve the performance of the global model under privacy constraints. Moreover, to solve the client-side unfairness issue in traditional federated learning caused by randomly selecting aggregation weights, a client selection method based on reservoir sampling is proposed, increasing the diversity of data distribution. Using the real-world databses, the effectiveness of FedFR is compared and analyzed through simulation experiments. The results show that FedFR exhibits good performance in terms of privacy protection levels, evaluation accuracy, and scalability.

We propose a deep metric learning-based anomaly detection to project the model gradients into a metric space where the malicious gradients are separated from benign ones. Meanwhile, while existing methods require an auxiliary dataset to train the defense model, the auxiliary dataset is usually unavailable to the server in the FL setting. We propose a self-supervised method to distill the data between the training epochs of our defense model. To handle radical changes in malicious model gradients, we utilize a median-based aggregated gradient filter to discard improper aggregated gradients. We show experimentally that our algorithm has a competitive performance over existing methods under Byzantine attacks and backdoor attacks with various triggers.",Federated learning;Adversarial attack;Anomaly detection

In FL, evaluating model quality is crucial for detecting malicious clients and improving model accuracy. However, existing methods typically require a representative public testing dataset on the server, which is often unavailable in practical federated learning scenarios. To address this problem, we propose a novel four-step framework, taking a crowdsourcing approach. The basic idea is to distribute the model to be evaluated as a task to a set of testing clients selected from the original clients pool, who evaluate the model quality using their local datasets. By consolidating these individual evaluations, we obtain the overall model quality. To select a suitable number of testing clients, we propose an exploration-exploitation-based framework. Furthermore, to safeguard against attacks from potential malicious testing clients, we introduce a Correlated Agreement (CA) mechanism. This is achieved by comparing correlations of accuracy among the same set of testing clients (who were selected for the aforementioned evaluation task). Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which yields accuracy comparable to methods that rely on a public testing dataset on the server. Moreover, our approach can identify and filter out dishonest testing clients and thereby ensure model quality even in adversarial settings.",Federated learning;crowdsourcing;model testing;correlated agreement
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,HDFL: Private and Robust Federated Learning using Hyperdimensional Computing,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Machine learning (ML) has seen widespread adoption across different domains and is used to make critical decisions. However, with profuse and diverse data available, collaboration is indispensable for ML. The traditional centralized ML for collaboration is susceptible to data theft and inference attacks. Federated learning (FL) promises secure collaborative machine learning by moving the model to the data. However, FL faces the challenge of data and model poisoning attacks. This is because FL provides autonomy to the participants. Many Byzantine-robust aggregation schemes exist to identify such poisoned model updates from participants. But, these schemes require raw access to the local model updates, which exposes them to inference attacks. Thus, the existing FL is still insecure to be adopted.This paper proposes the very first generic FL framework, which is both resistant to inference attacks and robust to poisoning attacks. The proposed framework uses hyperdimensional computing (HDC) coupled with FL, called HDFL. HDFL is compatible with different (ML) model architectures and existing Byzantine-robust defenses. HDFL restricts drop in accuracy to 1-2%. HDFL does not add any additional communication overheads and incurs negligible computational time in encoding and decoding raw local model updates. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of HDFL. HDFL performs secure aggregation and achieves no-attack accuracy, even in the presence of 40% attackers, in just 1.2s per iteration.",Machine Learning;Federated Learning;Inference Resistant;Byzantine Robust;Hyperdimensional Computing

However, due to its distributed nature, federated learning is vulnerable to Byzantine attacks. These attacks can poison the data or directly modify the model parameters, making the global model performance degrade or even leaving a backdoor. Existing strategies for mitigating Byzantine attacks require a priori information about the number of attackers or require additional validation datasets. However, prior knowledge of the number of Byzantine clients or the collection of representative validation datasets is not always feasible in practice. Moreover, recent research has shown that well-designed attacks can make malicious updates indistinguishable from benign ones by making them highly similar, thus bypassing existing defense methods that rely on these metrics.To tackle these problems, we propose Dynamic Clustering based Federated Learning (DCFL), a novel Byzantine robust FL approach without any additional validation datasets. The main idea behind DCFL is to rigorously constrain the magnitude and direction of local updates through norms and signs. To achieve this, we propose a novel metric that can effectively distinguish malicious updates from benign updates in terms of direction, which can help the server eliminate malicious updates before final aggregation. Our experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DCFL in mitigating various popular Byzantine attacks. Remarkably, the accuracy of the global model learned in the adversarial setting is even close to that of FedAVG under no attack.",Federated Learning;Byzantine Attack;Distributed Learning;Robustness

To address this problem, new classification frameworks based on Federated Learning (FL) have emerged for privacy preservation. However, research shows that these frameworks still face risks of indirect information leakage due to adversary inference. Unfortunately, existing research lacks an effective assessment of the extent and location of this leakage risk. To bridge the gap, we propose the FedDLM, which provides a fine-grained assessment of the risk of sensitive information leakage in an FL-based Android malware classifier. FedDLM estimates attackersâ€™ theoretical maximum inference ability from the information theory perspective to gauge the degree of leakage risk in the classifier effectively. It precisely identifies critical positions in the shared gradient where the leakage risk exists by utilizing characteristics of class activation in classifiers. Through extensive experiments on the Androzoo dataset, FedDLM demonstrates its superior effectiveness and precision compared to baseline methods in evaluating the risk of sensitive information leakage.

State sharding has emerged as a promising solution for addressing this challenge. However, conventional state allocation solutions often face two major obstacles: a high ratio of cross-shard transactions and an unbalanced workload distribution, due to their reliance on a simple and fixed assignment of states to shards. The former increases the overall workload on the system, while the latter reduces resource utilization. Both factors significantly impact system performance. Moreover, our key observation is that the collection of smart contract transactions can be represented as a hypergraph network by analyzing their characteristics. Therefore, this study proposes HyperChain, a novel dynamic state sharding protocol that integrates a hypergraph partition algorithm. HyperChain aims to reduce the ratio of cross-shard transactions and balance workload distribution, thereby achieving improved throughput and reduced transaction latency in smart contract blockchain systems. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed HyperChain exhibits superior performance than other solutions in terms of cross-shard transaction ratio, workload balance, throughput, and transaction latency.",Blockchain;Sharding;Scalability;Hypergraph

To address these challenges, this paper presents TI-DNS, a blockchain-based DNS resolution architecture designed to detect and correct the forged DNS records caused by the cache poisoning attacks in the DNS resolution process. TI-DNS leverages a multi-resolver Query Vote mechanism to ensure the credibility of verified records on the blockchain ledger and a stake-based incentive mechanism to promote well-behaved participation.

Smart contracts are programs that can automatically execute and handle cryptocurrency funds. However, over a hundred thousand new smart contracts are deployed every day and inevitably contain vulnerabilities due to programming errors. Once deployed, smart contracts cannot be fixed or changed, leaving funds at risk. To mitigate it, we use deep learning to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts. First, we create our own dataset of labeled smart contracts based on opcode sequences, since few smart contract codes and labeled datasets are publicly available. We collect opcode sequences by replaying real-world transactions from the Ethereum Mainnet in our fully synchronized node while we leverage a plugin called ""SODA"" to label opcode sequences with vulnerability classes. Second, after data collection, we preprocess the data by removing duplicate opcode sequences, normalizing the sequences to the same length, and converting them into vectors. Finally, to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, we train a deep classification model using LSTM neural networks.

It is thus of critical importance to design a solution to preserve the anonymity of both transaction amount and transaction peerâ€™s identity, which is changeable because the amount must be still authenticated in anonymity. In this paper, we propose a scheme by using Pedersen commitment to anonymize the transaction amount, and together using ring signature to conceal the transaction peerâ€™s identity while maintaining authentication.

However, existing permissioned blockchain frameworks typically use sequential serial workflows to invoke the consensus protocol and execute transactions for the application, resulting in significantly lower performance for these applications when deployed in traditional systems. Therefore, a new permissioned blockchain framework is needed to improve transaction processing efficiency and enhance system performance for practical blockchain technology applications. We propose IHFBF (Improved Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain Framework), an improved permissioned blockchain framework that employs a predictive transaction sorting method by selecting a node within the consensus nodes to act as a sorter. This enables parallel execution of the consensus protocol and transactions, resulting in improved overall system performance. However, if the sorter is a malicious node, it can severely impact system performance. To address this, IHFBF uses a view-change method based on a deny-list approach, which effectively guides all participants and replaces or denies malicious participants.

Large-scale BGP anomalies over the years have caused serious damage to the global Internet. Effective BGP anomaly detection helps early mitigation of BGP anomalies. Methods based on machine learning, especially graph learning, have achieved remarkable results. However, existing methods based on graph learning have two limitations. One is to use AS communication graphs as the input to the graph neural network model, ignoring the interactions between AS nodes that are physically topologically connected and weakening the perception of anomalous neighbouring nodes; and the other is to use the average features of all nodes as the features of the whole network, smoothing the differences of different nodes, reducing the detection performance while failing to support anomaly tracing. We propose a BGP anomaly detection method based on the spatio-temporal feature representation model for AS (ASSTFR). The ASSTFR model is based on the Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which automatically extracts spatio-temporal features of AS nodes, rather than the whole network. We use ASSTFR to predict AS features by combining the actual topological connection of AS nodes and the historical information of AS communication features. Thus, the anomaly score of each AS can be generated based on the prediction and observation of AS features. We aggregate AS node anomaly scores based on node importance to detect BGP anomalies, which can distinguish the different contributions of different nodes to the network. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the existing methods in all metrics. Compared with the best-performing existing method, the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of our method are improved by 2.7%, 3.0%, 2.3%, and 2.7% respectively.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,GuiDiv: Mitigating Code-reuse Attack in an IoT Cluster Using Guided Control Flow Diversification,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Code randomization, aka software diversification, is an effective way to mitigate code-reuse attacks. This mechanism diversifies the target software into heterogeneous variants, making a specific attack chain unfeasible for the transformed variants. Enhancing the heterogeneity of these variants is important for this method to reach its expected security level. Additionally, limiting their execution overhead is necessary to ensure the availability of this protection. However, finding the optimal subset among a large number of diversified variants is computationally difficult. This creates a dilemma in software diversification schema where enhancing heterogeneity and reducing execution overhead are both desired.To ensure a determined code quality control in generating software variants, we propose a guided software diversification mechanism (called GuiDiv). GuiDiv formalizes the iterate-used transformations into a branching process of a tree (called DivTree) and introduces an optimization process (called nodemerging) to guide the diversification. The optimizer evaluates the intermediate compilation results using multi-target evaluation functions in each iteration. This process aims to optimize the contribution of structural heterogeneity from redundant instructions, allowing variants with higher structural dissimilarity and lower overhead to have a higher chance of participating in the next iteration. We developed a proof-of-concept compilation module and used OpenSSL as the performance benchmark. In the evaluations, compared to related schemes, GuiDiv can bring higher control flow dissimilarity in most test cases. Regarding the variant heterogeneity, variants generated by GuiDiv exhibit significantly lower execution overhead.",internet of things;code-reuse attack;code randomization;guided software diversification

To create secure and safe IoT systems, a comprehensive risk assessment that can span the entire physical and cyber stack of IIoT systems is needed. In this article, we investigate the current risk assessment frameworks, discuss their strengths and challenges, and show that current frameworks do not sufficiently work for IIoT deployments.

While several studies have measured the performance of encrypted DNS relative to conventional DNS, they are only performed over IPv4, little has been done to understand their status over IPv6. Besides, previous studies can not obtain the absolute query latency due to lack of control over vantage points.This paper performs by far the fist end-to-end performance measurements on encrypted DNS over IPv6. By analyzing measurement results, we have gained several insights. In general, the quality of service for encrypted DNS is satisfying. Over IPv6, encrypted DNS performance varies across resolvers, and is affected by the location issuing DNS queries, the type of encrypted DNS protocol used and the latency to resolvers. Compared with IPv4, the performance of encrypted DNS of different resolvers over IPv6 is improved to some extent. In addition, we also find other problems such as the quality of service of resolver Ahadns is significantly low both over IPv6 and IPv4, as well as the performance of encrypted DNS for resolver Alidns significantly deteriorates when switching from IPv4 to IPv6. Based on our observations, we provide recommendations and discuss situations in which switching to IPv6 may be beneficial. We hope that our tools developed for performing measurements can help people in different regions to choose to the right recursive resolver and network environment, and that our findings can contribute to improve IPv6 Internet infrastructure and inform continuing encrypted DNS deployment over IPv6.",network measurement;quality of service;DNS-over-Encryption;IPv6

However, increasing private protocols become a hindrance to these features. The existing works study how to extract protocol keyword fields rather than infer the semantics of the fields, such as the length field, which can indicate the length associated with a message and is fundamental for deep analysis of network protocols. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric and unsupervised method, ROSE, to extract the length field of unknown binary network protocols from static traces. It segments the fields from the raw network trace and gets the inferred length of a subset of messages by clustering similar fields with k-means. Then, it generates candidate fields using n-gram and builds a multidimensional equation based on the length of the clustered messages and the candidate length fields. Finally, ROSE extracts the inferred length fields through linear regression. As far as we know, it is the first study on extracting length field from the static trace. The evaluation experiments using raw network traces exhibit high precision and recall in extracting the length field or identifying protocols without the length field.",Protocol reverse engineering;Network field extraction;Field clustering;Linear regression

The RNN cell enhances the temporal semantic information extraction ability while the added noise reduces the risk of performance collapse caused by skip-connections. Experimental results demonstrate that ECGSC-DARTS generates appropriate neural architectures for the semantic encoder under AWGN, Rayleigh and Rician channels and these architectures outperform a number of baseline models, such as the original DARTS, fully convolutional network, multi-layer perception, and ResNet, regarding F1-score.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Parallel Pattern Matching over Brotli Compressed Network Traffic,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Pattern matching is a crucial technique for network traffic detection applications. As a fundamental computation model used by pattern matching, the finite state automata execute sequential matching due to the state dependence among transitions. Meanwhile, most services tend to compress their data to improve transmission or storage efficiency. The increased compressed data challenges the straightforward method of matching the whole decompressed data and incurs data dependence among the compression encodings. The related approaches either leverage techniques to break the state dependence of matching uncompressed data or accelerate matching compressed data in a single-threaded manner without considering the state and data dependence. None of them can perform parallel matching over compressed data. This paper provides PETALS, a parallel pattern matching method over Brotli compressed network traffic. PETALS partitions the original compressed traffic into fixed- length blocks for parallel matching and patches the broken compression encodings crossing blocks to break the data dependence. Then, it merges the compressed traffic matching method into path fusion, an enumerative parallelization of finite state automata, to present parallel matching over compressed traffic. Evaluation using real-world network traffic and regular expressions shows that PETALS can raise the speedup from 1.53x to 3.53x of the state-of-the-art parallelization schemes on a 56-cores machine.",Parallelization;Compressed Traffic Matching;Brotli;Regular Expression Matching;Pattern Matching

As the usage of IoT devices significantly increases, at the same time, network edge infrastructure faces several security challenges. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is one of the most severe threats to edge-cloud services. Therefore, designing a robust mitigating system is unavoidable for the network edge, and it must be able to recognize emerging attacks. This work proposes an anomaly-based DDoS detection approach that combines information-theoretic metrics and multivariate correlation analysis. The information-theoretic metric captures the randomness and complex nature of traffic behaviour. Similarly, multivariate correlation analysis identifies the relationship among traffic features. Combining information metrics and correlation analysis, we generate normal and attack traffic profiles for the training base to estimate density. The generated profiles build on the metrics including Triangle Area Mapping (TAM) with correlation analysis, Renyiâ€™s divergence, covariance, mean, and standard deviation, which enhances the detection performance of the proposed approach. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated using testbed and benchmark datasets. The results show that the proposed approach achieves 0.17% and 2.32%, and 0.50% higher accuracy compared to the baseline approaches on the testbed, UNSW and CIC-DDoS datasets, respectively.",Network edge;Edge clouds;Correlation analysis;Information-theoretic triangle-MCA;DDoS

Currently, using artificial intelligence for traffic identification is the most promising direction. Due to the wide variety and rich configuration of OSPS, it is not feasible to train models for all tasks and deploy them on the same network device. It is a novel idea to improve efficiency by leveraging multi-task learning. However, the related studies still have three shortcomings. First, improving the performance of the main task through auxiliary tasks does not apply to equally important OSPS identification tasks. Second, the modelâ€™s ability to characterize traffic is weak, resulting in performance gaps between different tasks. Finally, the influence of task difficulty on convergence speed is ignored, which is easy to cause overfitting and underfitting. Aiming at the shortcomings, we propose Cerberus, an OSPS traffic identification scheme based on multi-task learning. The main contributions of our work can be summarized in three aspects. Firstly, a high-quality dataset is constructed through traffic collection, and three OSPS traffic identification tasks are defined on it. Secondly, an identification model is designed by optimizing the ability to characterize traffic and balancing the convergence speed of multiple tasks. Finally, Cerberus is verified through comparative experiments. Its classification performance is better than both single-task and multi-task solutions. Besides, Cerberus runs fast and consumes few resources, making it suitable for deployment on network devices.",open source proxy software;encrypted traffic identification;multi-task;deep learning

As an important means of protecting the privacy of network users, anti-tracking networks have gradually become one of the important research directions. However, the existing topology structures of anti-tracking networks still have problems such as intra-domain aggregation and key nodes, which are vulnerable to attack, tracking and destruction, and can not meet the privacy requirements. Therefore, this paper proposes a topology construction method based on cross-domain decentralized gravity model (CDTC). Firstly, the model comprehensively considers the local neighbor information, the location information of nodes, and the path information between nodes to calculate the node attraction. Secondly, each node determines its link status with other nodes through the model by ranking its local nodes, achieving optimization of the network topology.

In this context, they instrumented door handles with sensors like accelerometer, gyroscope, or touch and extracted features from complete opening interactions that include pushing down the handle, opening the door, entering the room, and releasing the handle. This work extends existing research with an evaluation whether already the initial door handleâ€™s push-down-phase (PDP) provides sufficient data for behavior-based authentication. For that, recorDOOR was built, a door handle prototype equipped with a camera, accelerometer, gyroscope, four touch stripes, and three ultrasonic distance sensors. We recorded 768 door interactions from eight participants (48 per hand) using recorDOOR, manually labeled the PDPâ€™s start and end, and when the door started moving using our camera stream. We are the first that recorded both hands and also simulated four real-life door opening scenarios including a novel opening careful scenario when standing in front of a door. Our quantitative analysis of the extracted PDPs shows that there is a high variance between PDP durations from less than 40 milliseconds to more than a second and that there are notable differences between left and right hand while opening independent of the scenario. Furthermore, over 95% of our participants started moving the door before the handle was pushed down to its maximum that further shortens the time for a user identification. Based on 235 extracted features and nested 5-fold cross-validation, a Gradient Boosting Classifier performed best and achieved a mean accuracy of 87.92% in an identification scenario for the overall PDP and 82.41% if only considering the PDP before the door is already moved.",Behavioral Authentication;Identification;Door;Door Handle;Push Down;Sensors

Twitter, as a vital source of real-time threat information, provides abundant but overwhelming information due to the increased data sources. Automatically mining and summarizing fine-grained threat information from Twitter can help security analysts maintain the infrastructureâ€™s security. Most existing studies focus on classification, which carries less threat information. Some works use clustering based on text similarity relying on the embedding of text obtained from pre-trained models, which cannot be applied to short text, resulting in noisy clusters. Several works build topic models. However, the incoherent topic keywords are difficult to understand and analyze. To overcome these challenges, we design a FineCTI framework to mine the threat information related to the specific infrastructure on Twitter and generate a detailed threat information summary that is machine-readable and human-readable, efficiently reducing information overload. FineCTI optimizes the feature extraction part based on the named entity recognition model and performs clustering based on features extracted, thus effectively reducing the influence of sparsity of tweets on the clustering result and with the V-measure score improved by 7%.

It is essentially difficult to execute HIDS securely inside target systems. For example, it is not guaranteed that HIDS can obtain correct information from compromised systems. If HIDS is tampered with by intruders, it would be easily disabled. So far, various techniques have been proposed to securely execute HIDS using the security features of processors, e.g., System Management Mode (SMM) and SGX in Intel processors. However, strongly secure HIDS sacrifices its manageability, whereas manageable HIDS is less secure. In practice, it is important to achieve not only the security but also the manageability of HIDS. This paper proposes SSdetector for achieving both security and manageability by combining SGX and SMM. SSdetector securely runs HIDS inside an SGX enclave, which is a protected region inside an SGX application. Since HIDS is developed as an SGX application, the management of HIDS is easier. To securely obtain system information in memory, in-enclave HIDS invokes the SMM monitor running in an isolated execution environment created by BIOS. SSdetector protects information passed between in-enclave HIDS and the SMM monitor by encryption and integrity checking.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Towards Understanding Checkpointing in Transiently Powered IoT Networks,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"The finite energy supply available for computation and communication is one of the major shortcomings in IoT/sensor networks. To circumvent this issue, energy harvesting has been proposed to enable embedded devices to mitigate their dependency on traditional battery-driven power sources. However, energy supply due to energy harvesting often varies, leading to nodes crashing due to energy exhaustion, with the application(s) losing their state. Efficient state checkpointing in non-volatile memory (NVM) has been proposed to enable forward progress, albeit at the expense of significant overheads (viz., energy and time). This work is based on the observation that, as the network evolves, IoT applications adapt/refresh to ensure they have up-to-date state of information, thereby reducing the need for checkpointing. However, little is known about (i) whether checkpointing is actually needed for any application, (ii) if needed, what to checkpoint for a given application and (iii) when checkpointing is needed in an application. In this paper, we address the first two problems and make the following novel contributions: (i) we formalise a variant of the checkpointing problem for IoT networks and show that it is NP-complete, (ii) we introduce a theory of state checkpointing and develop two types of checkpointing: (a) local checkpointing and (b) network checkpointing, (iii) we show that there is no general checkpointing strategy for the network-based application that will improve efficiency and (iv) we briefly survey related works and show that most if not all, works on checkpointing of IoT-based applications that lead to increased efficiency have focused on node-centric (i.e., local) programs. We run experiments on an actual testbed to confirm our expectations, and our results show that checkpointing can actually have a negative impact on applications when wrongly used.

However, vehicles with selfish behaviors rarely provide high-performance communication services to others, resulting in a low packet delivery ratio and a high end-to-end delay. It is extremely challenging to substantially alleviate the influence of selfish vehicles in vehicular networks, because of the network topology and unstable communication qualities. To address the above problems, the Social similarity and Reputation Based Routing (SRBR) is proposed, considering social relationships, vehicle behaviors, and transmission capacity. The social similarity can improve network performance by leveraging the social relationships of vehicles, while reputation mechanisms can effectively defend against selfish vehiclesâ€™ attacks. Additionally, to integrate the above two-dimensional metrics, fuzzy logic is employed.

Potential attackers change their behaviour over time and remain undetected due to the adhoc nature of VANET. Capturing the dynamic attacker behaviour and updating the corresponding neighbourhood information without compromising the quality of service requirements is an ongoing challenge. This work proposes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based neighbour selection framework for VANET with an adaptive trust management system to capture the behavioural changes of potential attackers and to dynamically update the neighbourhood information. In contrast to existing works, we consider trust and link-life time in unison as neighbour selection criteria to achieve trustworthy communication. Our adaptive trust model takes into account the social relationship, time and confidence in trust observation to avoid four types of attackers. To update the neighbourhood information, our framework sets the learning rate of the RL agent according to the velocities of the neighbour nodes to improve the modelâ€™s adaptability to network topology changes. Results demonstrate that our method can take less number of hops to the destination for large network sizes while can response is up to 54% faster compared to a baseline method.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Inter-slice Correlation Weighted Fusion for Universal Lesion Detection,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Universal lesion detection using computerised tomography (CT) scans is a critical computer-aided diagnosis measure in clinical diagnosis. One of the key issues during the diagnosis is to identify the correlations between sequential slices to improve the feature representation of CT scans. In the process of fusing slice features containing temporal correlations, the correlation between the contextual slices in the channel dimension and the target slices is closely related to the spatial distance in practice. However, convolutional fusion approaches commonly ignore that features of different distances have unequal weights. To tackle this issue, we present a temporal correlation weighted fusion lesion detection network, called TCW-Net. Specifically, for the slices in the channel dimension, we develop a weighted feature fusion module to adjust the more discriminative features using learned weights. Then, we adapt a spatial offset attention mechanism that allows the detection network to pay more attention to the lesionâ€™s slight spatial offset and thus improve the modelâ€™s capacity for distinguishing between different lesion features.

Recent methods employing deep learning concentrate on alterations in node-dependent substructures within dynamic networks, yielding superior outcomes compared to graph embedding-based techniques. Nevertheless, these methods grapple with two primary problems in dynamic network anomaly detection: the disruption caused by relevant neighbors during node sampling and the inadequate integration of spatio-temporal information. To address these issues, we propose a framework ESEAD for anomaly edge detection in dynamic networks in this paper. This proposed framework devises a random walk-based node sampling strategy, selecting nodes intimately associated with the edge under scrutiny, and designs an encoder model utilizing a multi-headed attention mechanism to learn the spatio-temporal features of the edge neighborhood. Subsequently, these domain-specific spatio-temporal features are fed into an anomaly discriminator for anomaly detection. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed ESEAD framework surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods across five real-world datasets.",Anomaly Detection;Dynamic Networks;Deep Learning;Node Sampling;Multi-head Attention Mechanism

To solve the issues, we propose a DGA domain name detection method based on two-stage feature reinforcement. Firstly, we encode the domain name to obtain the domain name word vector. Secondly, the slice pyramid network (SPN) is used to process the word vector to extract the domain name feature. Thirdly, we reinforce the domain name feature by using the two-stage reinforcement method we proposed. The two-stage reinforcement method reinforces the domain name feature by adding domain name semantic information to the extracted features and reducing feature information redundancy to improve the stability of the domain name feature, meanwhile, we convert the reinforced domain name feature to the primary capsules to reduce feature loss. Finally, we use the dynamic routing algorithm to process the primary capsules to generate digital capsules, and then the digital capsules are used to detect domain names. Experimental results on domain name detection and domain name family classification both show that compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method has better detection performances.",DGA domain name detection;slice pyramid network;two-stage feature reinforcement;dynamic routing algorithm
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,High-knowledge shilling attack detection method based on genetic co-forest,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Shilling attack is the behavior of malicious users to elevate or suppress ratings in collaborative filtering recommendation system, which can destroy the balance of recommendation and disrupt the order of competition. In previous studies, shilling attack detection techniques can be divided into three categories according to the labeling scale of samples: supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods. The semi-supervised method is better at using a small number of labeled samples and a large number of unlabeled samples to improve the detection efficiency. However, in practice, it is found that the existing semi-supervised methods perform poorly in the face of high-knowledge shilling attacks such as PUA and PIA, and the generalization ability is significantly reduced when the proportion of labeled data becomes smaller. Therefore, this paper proposes a semi-supervised detection method GA-CoF. Different from the existing divergent semi-supervisors, the proposed method regards the solution set of unlabeled samples as gene sequences, the error rate as the fitness function, and the aggregation degree as the penalty term. In the experiments, we extract the user behavior characteristics of standard shilling attacks, and compare our method with four representative shilling attack detection algorithms on two datasets, MovieLens-25M and Amazon-5Cores. The results show that our method can maintain high F1 score and is not sensitive to the attack scale when facing high-knowledge shilling attacks, and performs well on real datasets.

Existing methods utilize statistical characteristics of side-channel features, such as the mean packet length, to identify encrypted traffic. However, packet lengths are constrained by the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) of the TCP protocol. This constraint causes the length-varied sequence to be encapsulated into segments of equal length, resulting in information loss. Moreover, flow-level statistical features are vulnerable to interference from noisy packets, making it challenging to detect malicious traffic injected with benign packets effectively. In this paper, we propose an encrypted traffic detection model based on Record length and frEquency Domain Analysis (REDA). First, we reconstruct the TLS Record Length Sequence (TRLS), which is a length-varied sequence, to capture differences in traffic content during transmission. Second, we employ the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to extract frequency domain features of the TRLS, which are resistant to attacker interference. Finally, an improved One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) algorithm is devised for the unsupervised detection of malicious traffic, enabling the identification of unknown attacks.

The multi-step attack has become the mainstream attack form, where adversaries implement multiple attack steps to achieve their goals, which poses server challenges to attack detection. Traditional research mainly concentrates on how a particular attack step is exploited but fails to identify the whole attack activity automatically. Manual analysis is required to correlate multiple steps and determine the fine-grained type of attack activities, which is a heavy workload. In addition, the high error rate of alerts results in a negative impact on attack-activity detection performance.To address these challenges, we propose a framework, LActDet, to automatically identify attack activities from the raw alerts end-to-end. Firstly, it utilizes a document-embedding method to vectorize attack-event descriptions. Second, a seq2seq model is implemented to embed the attack-event sequence into the attack-phase sequence to represent the framework of attack activity, aiming at improving the fault tolerance for error alerts. In the end, we propose a temporal-sequence-based classifier to identify attack activities.

In recent years, several anomaly detection approaches have been proposed. However, detecting anomalies of KPIs remains challenging because of the stochastic nature and complex temporal dependence of multivariate time series. Additionally, the presence of noise and the unavailability of labeled data in large-scale datasets limit the effectiveness of anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose IAD-Net, an interpretable anomaly detection method with Dual Gated Residual Fusion Networks. The main idea is to model the inter-metric and temporal dependencies simultaneously by using gated residual blocks and two-stream fusion. Additionally, we utilize Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to extract long-term global trend patterns of an input sequence. Finally, both the forecasting-based model and the reconstruction-based model are combined in order to focus on single-timestamp predictions and latent representations of time series.

By analyzing the hierarchical structure of traffic, we integrated certain natural language processing (NLP) techniques into our method. We designed a relative time-delay positional encoding module to embed the relative time delay information between traffic data packets into the positional encoding. Leveraging multi-head self-attention, we extracted spatio-temporal features, which significantly enhanced our modelâ€™s ability to detect malicious traffic and improved its generalization capability.

Many times, these interactions involve sensitive information and/or sensitive commands, leading to the need for trusted paths between humans and computers. For computer-to-computer interactions, secure communication is not an issue thanks to cryptographic protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and the IP Security Protocol (IPSec). However, the same does not yet apply to interactions between humans and computers due to the inability of humans to execute non-trivial cryptographic algorithms. This results in interactions that are vulnerable to shoulder surfing, man-in-the-browser malware, and web page spoofing, among other attacks. This consequently puts at risk the use of sensitive services in uncontrolled environments.We present TrustGlass, a scheme that uses augmented reality smart glasses to solve this security problem. TrustGlass uses such glasses to extend human capabilities, to execute the cryptographic algorithms needed to establish a trusted path between the user and the trusted service, which can be executed in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).

In Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud environments, the provider is fully trusted, making it essential to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of cloud applications and data. As a novel security technology, confidential computing strives to decrease reliance on cloud providers by delivering the smallest Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and providing enhanced end-to-end data protection capabilities within the cloud environment.This paper proposes an efficient scheme for remote attestation and monitoring the integrity of confidential computing platforms based on a hardware root of trust, addressing the load-time and run-time trust problems of cluster nodes in a confidential cloud environment. The scheme uses Trusted Platform Module (TPM) as the identity of hardware root of trust to achieve secure registration and attestation. Additionally, the scheme ensures load-time trust by binding the boot state to PCRs through TPM2.0 policy authorization mechanism. To ensure secure transmission of sensitive data between nodes, trusted channels are established for the remote attestation with key agreements. Runtime integrity is ensured by periodically attesting nodes with the EpochID-based integrity monitoring. This paper also analyzes the security of the proposed scheme. We implement the prototype to proves the efficiency and feasibility based on TPM2 and x86 confidential platform.

The proposal of the hardware trusted execution environment (TEE) like Intel SGX provides an alternative for trusted computing on untrusted hosts. TEE can be used to construct privacy preserving scheme for KV stores. The current research on secure persistent KV store is limited to the shielded execution framework which involves a large trusted computing base and high overhead.In this paper, we propose Pldb, a secure persistent KV store that is based on Log-Structured Merge (LSM) tree. In order to ensure security, TEEâ€™s access to persistent storage data needs to pass through the encryption/decryption interface. This is the main overhead of secure KV data storage based on TEE design. We designed a hybrid KV storage structure, which encrypts the value data and stores it directly on the disk, thereby reducing the encryption/decryption interface calls through the TEE. With a carefully designed architecture leveraging Intel SGX, Pldb provides security properties including confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and data freshness to prevent rollback attacks.

Existing studies usually treat them based on usefulness or sentiment analysis as a single task, but it is easy to ignore the latent features among different data domain and the potential causal relationships of various tasks. In this study, we focus on the multi-task deep learning, to cope with the reputation and trust analysis in e-commerce systems using product reviews.

Meanwhile, difficulties may arise if the sender is unwilling to disclose the signing key to the receiver. In this paper, we propose a broadband subliminal channel that can be used in digital signature schemes (e.g., DSA, ECDSA, ElGamal, and Schnorr) without disclosing the signing key to the receiver. As it writes the message on a digital signature, we call it WMoS. We first implement WMoS in the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). We then provide the security proof to show that signatures generated in WMoS have the same security level as standard ECDSA signatures. Moreover, we discuss the variants of WMoS in ECDSA and use them to construct applications.

Subsequently, the auxiliary server clusters the images with the proximity relationships among their vector representations and employs the vertical bisecting lines of the key points to partition the clustered subspaces to encrypted indexes, namely the clustering encryption index of vertical subspace (CEIVS). This process efficiently filters out irrelevant images in advance, thereby enhancing the efficiency of encrypted retrieval. Ultimately, the Enhanced Asymmetric Scalar Product-preserving Encryption (E-ASPE) technique is adopted to ensure the security of the feature vectors, and a binary verification mechanism is proposed to detect data tampering, thereby ensuring the integrity of the retrieval results.

Designing practical and robust authentication key agreement (AKA) schemes for smart environments has become a pressing problem to be solved. Due to differences in security requirements and resource allocation in smart environments, which we call security-asymmetry and resource-asymmetry, it is necessary to design specific AKA schemes for this environment. Since the design of remote AKA protocols does not fully consider security-asymmetry and resource-asymmetry, many existing schemes are not practical in smart environments. With regard to security-asymmetry, compared with traditional public-key techniques applied in AKA schemes, chaotic map is more effective than modular exponentiation and scalar multiplication, and it supplies many feasible attributes such as unpredictability, unrepeatability, uncertainty, which can be used to achieve communication security between users and gateways, while security operations based on hash function are sufficient to secure communications between gateways and smart devices. In view of resource-asymmetry, the complex operations in the authentication process can be completed by the gateway, so as to make full use of the rich resources on gateway side and reduce the use of resources on user side and device side. Based on such considerations, an efficient and secure authentication key agreement scheme based on chaotic map and physical unclonable function (PUF) for smart environments is proposed. We present a rigorous informal analysis of the proposed scheme. Moreover, the formal security verification is accomplished using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Differential Privacy Frequent Closed Itemset Mining over Data Stream,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"As the most common technique for mining and analyzing massive data, frequent itemset mining is widely used in various scenarios. However, when the data contains sensitive information, it will bring serious privacy leakage risks to mining and publishing it directly. Therefore, how to efficiently mine frequent itemset without privacy disclosure is a hot issue at present. In data stream, because the data between adjacent timestamps possess certain correlation, which makes it easier to leak privacy for frequent itemset mining in the data stream, and considering that frequent itemset will have combinatorial explosion problem in data stream, frequent closed itemset mining in the data stream will be a better choice. In this paper, we propose a differential privacy algorithm for mining frequent closed itemset in data stream, which is referred to as DPES. The algorithm uses a vertical mining method in each sliding window, which can quickly obtain the frequent closed itemset contained in the current window. Besides, to improve the data utility, we also design an adaptive privacy budget allocation strategy by computing the difference to decide whether the current timestamp should publish a low-noise statistic or an approximate statistic. Finally, we demonstrate that the DPES algorithm satisfies Îµ-difference privacy by privacy analysis, and the experimental results on several real datasets also show the effectiveness of the DPES algorithm.",Frequent closed itemset mining;Differential privacy;Data stream
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,MPS: A Multiple Poisoned Samples Selection Strategy in Backdoor Attack,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Recently there has been many studies on backdoor attacks, which involve injecting poisoned samples into the training set in order to embed backdoors into the model. Existing multiple poisoned samples attacks usually randomly select a subset from clean samples to generate the poisoned samples. Filtering-and-Updating Strategy (FUS) has shown that the poisoning efficiency of each poisoned sample is inconsistent and random selection is not optimal. However, FUS does not fully considered the selection of multiple poisoned samples, there are still some issues with the selection of multiple poisoned samples. In this paper, we formulate the selection of multiple types of poisoned samples as a multi-objective optimization problem and proposed a Multiple Poisoned Samples Selection Strategy (MPS) to solve the issue. Unlike FUS, we consider the potential of clean samples that are not selected as to become efficient poisoned samples. Specifically, we use a weight-based contribution approach to calculate the contribution of each sample (clean sample and poisoned sample) during the training process from multiple dimensions. Finally, based on the greedy approach, we retain a subset of samples with the largest contribution in each dimension through iterations. We evaluate the effectiveness of MPS on various attack methods, including BadNet, Blended, ISSBA, and WaNet, as well as benchmark datasets. The experimental results on CIFAR-10 and GTSRB show that MPS can increase the attack strength by 1.45% to 18.34% compared to RSS and 0.43% to 10.84% compared to FUS in multiple poisoned samples attacks, thereby enhancing the stealthiness of the attack. Meanwhile, MPS is suitable for black-box settings, meaning that poisoned samples selected in one setting can be applied to other settings.",Backdoor attack;Multiple poisoned samples;Poisoning efficiency;Optimization problem;Stealthiness

In this paper, we propose an evolved Android malware detection method (EAMDM). Two components comprise EAMDM: API clustering and malware detection. Before malware detection, we perform API clustering to obtain cluster centers representing the function of each API. we employ Bert to comprehensively extract the semantic information contained in API features such as method name, exception, and permission. Bert generates feature vectors for clustering that represent the similarity of API functions. In malware detection, EAMDM abstracts the API into cluster centers in order to maintain resilience against the frequent changes of API in both malware and Android framework.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,SPSW: Database Watermarking Based on Fake Tuples and Sparse Priority Strategy,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Databases play a crucial role in storing and managing vast amounts of data in various organizations and industries. Yet the risk of database leakage poses a significant threat to data privacy and security. To trace the source of database leakage, researchers have proposed many database watermarking schemes. Among them, fake-tuples-based database watermarking shows great potential as it does not modify the original data of the database, ensuring the seamless usability of the watermarked database. However, the existing fake-tuple-based database watermarking schemes need to insert a large number of fake tuples for the embedding of each watermark bit, resulting in low watermark transparency. Therefore, we propose a novel database watermarking scheme based on fake tuples and sparse priority strategy, named SPSW, which achieves the same watermark capacity with a lower number of inserted fake tuples compared to the existing embedding strategy. Specifically, for a database about to be watermarked, we prioritize embedding the sparsest watermark sequence, i.e., the sequence containing the most â€˜0â€™ bits among the currently available watermark sequences. For each bit in the sparse watermark sequence, when it is set to â€˜1â€™, SPSW will embed the corresponding set of fake tuples into the database. Otherwise, no modifications will be made to the database. Through theoretical analysis, the proposed sparse priority strategy not only improves transparency but also enhances the robustness of the watermark. The comparative experimental results with other database watermarking schemes further validate the superior performance of the proposed SPSW, aligning with the theoretical analysis.",Database watermarking;Sparse priority strategy;Fake tuples

To handle these issues, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised and effective method for extracting software features and detecting software vulnerabilities automatically. Firstly, we obtain software features and build a new pre-trained BERT model through constructing C/C++ vocabulary and pre-training on software source code. We then fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model with a deep autoencoder and create low-dimensional embedding from the software features. We finally apply a clustering-based outlier detection method on the embedding to detect vulnerabilities.

Most of these cross-core cache side-channel attacks take advantage of the feature that the last-level cache (LLC) is shared by all cores. However, these attacks may not perform well in cross-core attacks on processors that the LLC is not shared by all cores. This paper mainly focuses on the AMD Zen series processors, which introduce the design of the CPU complex (or Core Complex, CCX), and different CCXs have their independent LLCs. We find that previous cross-core cache side-channel attacks such as Flush+Reload do not work well in crossing CCXs on these processors, as these attacks mainly utilize the sharing characteristics of the LLC between different cores. In this paper, we present a cross-CCX side-channel attack named Flush+Revisit. As far as we know, we are the first to study cross-CCX side-channel attacks on AMD processors. Compared with traditional cache side-channel attacks, when crossing CCX, a more distinguishable time difference can be observed between accessed and unaccessed addresses with Flush+Revisit. We have carried out evaluation experiments to show that Flush+Revisit is an effective cross-CCX side-channel attack on an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X processor, which is known to have employed the CCX structure. In addition, we have also applied Flush+Revisit in a real-world attack scenario: attacking the T-Table-based AES implementation of OpenSSL in the cross-CCX scenario and leaking the full 128-bit key on the AMD Ryzen 7 3700X processor within 3.75 seconds successfully, with an error rate of 0.00%.",Flush+Revisit;side-channel attacks;CPU Complex (CCX);Core Complex (CCX);cross-CCX;AMD processors

Traditional adversarial attack methods, such as the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), are designed for a white-box setting where attackers have complete knowledge of the inner workings of the target systems. This limits the practicality of these attacks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new attack model that uses a neural network to generate adversarial examples directly, without the need for full knowledge of the recognition model in a target SRS. In addition, we have designed a novel loss function to balance the effectiveness and confidentiality of adversarial examples. Our new approach was evaluated against SincNet, a state-of- the-art SRS.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,SATBA: An Invisible Backdoor Attack Based on Spatial Attention,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Backdoor attack has emerged as a novel and concerning threat to AI security. These attacks involve the training of Deep Neural Network (DNN) on datasets that contain hidden trigger patterns. Although the poisoned model behaves normally on benign samples, it exhibits abnormal behavior on samples containing the trigger pattern. However, most existing backdoor attacks suffer from two significant drawbacks: their trigger patterns are visible and easy to detect by backdoor defense or even human inspection, and their injection process results in the loss of natural sample features and trigger patterns, thereby reducing the attack success rate and model accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack named SATBA that overcomes these limitations using spatial attention and an U-net based model. The attack process begins by using spatial attention to extract meaningful data features and generate trigger patterns associated with clean images. Then, an U-shaped model is used to embed these trigger patterns into the original data without causing noticeable feature loss. We evaluate our attack on three prominent image classification DNN across three standard datasets. The results demonstrate that SATBA achieves high attack success rate while maintaining robustness against backdoor defenses. Furthermore, we conduct extensive image similarity experiments to emphasize the stealthiness of our attack strategy. Overall, SATBA presents a promising approach to backdoor attack, addressing the shortcomings of previous methods and showcasing its effectiveness in evading detection and maintaining high attack success rate.",backdoor attack;deep neural network;spatial attention;U-net

Therefore, we propose a novel in-memory key-value storage architecture, DNVPL, which utilizes NVRAM to log parity data. Our main idea is to design an appending-only update scheme to tradeoff the memory cost and the update overhead. We implement DNVPL with an in-memory key-value storage prototype, called LogKV.

To improve the computational performance, we further propose a Secure Grid Filtering (SGF) method by matching spatio-temporal grid codes to filter the dissimilar trajectories based on the distance threshold in MPS. At last, with SMPSC protocol and SGF method, we propose a Secure Synchronized Spatio-Temporal Trajectory similarity Search Processing (S3TS) method to retrieve similar trajectories based on MPS measurement.

It is desirable for oblivious document ranking and retrieval in public cloud at lower cost and faster speed without revealing query-related information. Currently, the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and private information retrieval (PIR) techniques are used to solve this problem, but the encryption operation time is over dominant. Motivated by the observation of the sparsity of the TF-IDF matrix, we propose an efficient approach for oblivious document ranking and retrieval, called E-Coeus. It takes advantage of the high sparsity of the TF-IDF matrix to rearrange the matrix. Our method accelerates the speed of PIR inadvertently retrieving documents and reduces the user retrieval delay time. In a stand-alone experiment for a TF-IDF matrix of 1.2M rows and 64K columns with the sparsity of 10%, E-Coeus improves the document ranking and retrieval performance by 23% over the state-of-the-art approach, Coeus.

Lastly, LF incorporates seed scheduling with feedback information of control flow at the function level to dynamically target JIT.

However, despite its safety advantages, there are still many serious bugs in existing Rust projects. The lack of suitable fuzz targets has been a major challenge in Rust fuzz testing, as existing fuzzing tools often rely on manual efforts to write test targets, which is time-consuming and cannot be directly applied to library function interfaces. While the previous work has made significant progress in generating fuzz targets for Rust, it still cannot effectively test special functions with generics and polymorphism.To address this issue, this paper proposes an automated approach for generating fuzz targets for Rust library functions, called RVFuzz. RVFuzz addresses the challenges by performing static analysis through variable instantiation, ensuring that special functions in Rust, such as those with generics and polymorphism, are covered in the interface sequence analysis. It then traverses the library function dependency graph to generate a set of reasonable and non-redundant target function sequences for fuzz testing. Any compilation errors encountered during the process are used to refine the sequence generation.

However, this approach still has limitations: The attacker cannot tell whether the target HS is some HS that is not in the set of sites he mirrors, i.e, an HS in the wild. To address this, we propose a novel two-phase approach to deanonymize HSs that using the website fingerprint collected on the remote node, i.e., a node on the same RP circuit with HS.

To achieve this, there are two main steps to craft our scheme. Firstly, we decompose a cyclotomic ring into two smaller subrings R1 for the ciphertext space and â„›2 for the base as slots. The ciphertext is then extracted with basic automorphic rotations. In this way, we obtain a batch RGSW scheme with ciphertext slots in size of $\tilde O\left( {{\lambda ^{0.5}}} \right)$.

The primary goal of device fingerprinting is to accurately and uniquely identify a device, which requires the generated device fingerprints to have good stability to achieve long-term tracking of the target device. However, the fingerprints generated by some existing fingerprinting technologies are not stable enough or change frequently, making it impossible to track the target device for a long time. In this paper, we present FPHammer, a novel DRAM-based fingerprinting technique. The device fingerprint generated by our technique has high stability and can be used to track the device for a long time. We leverage the Rowhammer technique to repeatedly and quickly access a row in DRAM to get bit flips in its adjacent row. We then construct a physical fingerprint of the device based on the locations of the collected bit flips. The evaluation results of the uniqueness and reliability of the physical fingerprint show that it can be used to distinguish devices with the same hardware and software configuration. The experimental results on device identification demonstrate that the physical fingerprints engendered by our innovative technique are inherently linked to the entirety of the device rather than just the DRAM module. Even if the device modifies software-level parameters such as MAC address and IP address or even reinstalls the operating system, we can accurately identify the target device. This demonstrates that FPHammer can generate stable fingerprints that are not affected by software layer parameters.",

At the core of the framework lies a mechanism that transforms any formula to a random one with the same number of satisfying assignments. As a result, obfuscated formulas are indistinguishable from each other thus preserving the input-output privacy of the original SAT instance. Contrary to prior solutions that are rather adhoc in nature, we formally prove the security of our scheme. Additionally, we show that obfuscated formulas are within a polynomial factor of the original ones thus achieving polynomial slowdown.

Specifically, our framework uses modified stretching mechanism with an innovative rescaling scheme to achieve better trade-off between privacy and accuracy. Meanwhile, by allocating privacy budget properly, we can capture homogeneous privacy preference within a user/item but heterogeneous privacy preference across different users/items. Theoretical analysis confirms that HDPMF renders rigorous privacy guarantee, and exhaustive experiments demonstrate its superiority especially in strong privacy guarantee, high dimension model and sparse dataset scenario.",untrusted recommender;decentralized matrix factorization;heterogeneous differential privacy

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Multi-Scale Feature Aggregation for Rumor Detection: Unveiling the Truth within Text,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Social media plays a significant role in our lives, providing convenience in accessing information and expressing opinions through various platforms. However, this convenience has also led to the proliferation of rumors. Therefore, detecting rumors on social media has become increasingly important. Many existing works focus on detecting rumors by analyzing source posts and comments posted by users, utilizing pre-trained language models to capture text representations. However, simply averaging the comments from different users fails to capture the correlation between comments and source posts, which is crucial for rumor detection. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a multi-scale feature aggregation method. We utilize a BERT-based pre-trained language model to encode the source posts and comment texts, obtaining token scale feature representations. Furthermore, to differentiate between different comments, we perform secondary aggregation of features at the comment scale, mitigating the limitations of previous methods that treat all comments equally. We then employ an attention layer to obtain a correlation weight matrix between the source posts and comments, which represents their correlation. This approach significantly extracts comment content most relevant to the current event being detected. Experimental results on existing datasets in both Chinese and English demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to other existing approaches. Further experiments also confirm the importance of the multi-scale approach in mining the correlation between source posts and comments for rumor detection.",Rumor Detection;Multi-Scale;Comments

Given the varying sensitivity levels of this data, it is important to offer users control over their data and privacy. To address this, we propose an end-to-end privacy preserving framework that ensures the integrity, confidentiality, and traceability of data related to user privacy within a connected vehicle. This framework combines data tainting for data traceability, lightweight signature for data integrity, and attribute-based encryption for confidentiality and access control to effectively enforce privacy policies set by both vehicle users and manufacturers.

To enhance the robustness of SIS system, it is vital to study SIS technology that can resist shadow image cropping. Unfortunately, the current research on this topic is limited. In view of this, this paper proposes a robust SIS scheme for color images, which can resist large-scale shadow image cropping. The proposed scheme generates shadow images of the same size as the original secret image by integrating SIS, error correction coding, and pixel re-arrangement techniques. Even in the extreme case that all shadow images are cropped by 25%, it can still achieve lossless recovery regardless of whether the cropping positions of each shadow image intersect or overlap. In addition, it can resist shadow image noise, such as salt-and-pepper noise. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has significant advantages over existing schemes in robustness and overall performance and is expected to promote the practical application of SIS.",Secret image sharing;Robustness;Cropping;Lossless Recovery;Reed-Solomon Coding

Compared with deep learning, green learning has the advantages of a low carbon footprint, lightweight model and logical transparency. In this paper, to enhance the robustness of green learning, we study the performance of the green model when the training dataset labels are noisy. Through theoretical analysis and experimental verification, we found that noisy labels will not only reduce the performance of green learning, but also amplify the risk of privacy leaks of training dataset members. Therefore, we propose a robust green learning to approach the above two threats. Specifically, we design a multi-stage label-consistency sample selection method to filter out noisy labels in the training dataset by taking advantage of the characteristics of unsupervised representation learning in green learning. In order to further improve the stable classification performance of the model, we propose a feature-level class-balanced data augmentation method in the feature decision learning stage to solve the class imbalance problem caused by sample selection.

In such a context, the evaluation of the robustness of biometric authenticators is paramount to assessing their resilience potential and derive deployment strategies. Through this work, we propose a generic assessment method, based on a metric which quantifies the robustness of biometrics against cyber-attacks. Our methodology can be adapted to different families of cyber-attacks targeting biometric authentication techniques. We demonstrate our approach by considering spoofing-attacks. To achieve this objective, we present an extended state-of-the-art of biometrics (physiological and behavioural), including emerging biometric technologies.

The emergence of mKCP has received widespread attention. Whether mKCP can provide secure network access that protects user privacy is the focus. Traditional methods cannot identify mKCP camouflage traffic, but machine learning (ML)-based traffic identification is considered a promising direction. Unlike the previous network traffic classification, mKCP camouflage traffic identification introduces new challenges. First, existing work has neither published any dataset containing mKCP camouflage traffic nor designed specific traffic features.

Aiming at the shortcomings, we propose SharpEye, an ML-based mKCP camouflage traffic identification scheme. The novelty of our work lies in three points. Firstly, a complete dataset containing mKCP camouflage traffic is constructed through long-term traffic collection. Secondly, by analyzing the communication patterns of mKCP traffic, a feature set mFS is designed to improve identification accuracy. Finally, a two-stage feature selection method mGBFS is proposed to improve the operation efficiency. The experimental results show that mFS can enhance the performance of classifiers in identifying mKCP camouflage traffic, and mGBFS reduces the running time and overhead while ensuring high accuracy.

Because the topology of LEO satellite networks frequently changes, traditional scheduling strategies may lead to an increase in total task delay while scheduling multiple computing subtasks to satellite nodes. Therefore, this paper proposes a fine-grained task scheduling algorithm (DDPG-FTS) based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). This algorithm continuously interacts with the LEO satellite network environment, learning the selection strategy of satellite nodes. In addition, in order to reduce the path re-plan delay during task transmission, a path selection algorithm for the LEO satellite network is introduced. The algorithm reduces the path re-plan caused by Inter-Satellite Link (ISL) connectivity changes and effectively reduces the transmission delay of tasks.

Furthermore, most studies of biometrics-enabled pattern locks were conducted in controlled lab environments. As such, in this work, our goal is to investigate and validate the performance of touch behavior-enabled Android pattern locks in a more practical scenario, in which users have to download the application and learn to use it by themselves (as was often the case during the pandemic). During the course of our investigation, we collected substantial data, namely, the properties provided by the Android API for motion events, as well as measurements that could be extracted from the devicesâ€™ sensors. Our investigation found that touch-enabled Android pattern locks could achieve an average equal error ratio of 23.5% for user authenticationâ€”without changing the process from the userâ€™s perspective. Next, we modified the user experience such that each user would train the authenticator with different fingers, similar to fingerprint-based authentication.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Analysing Utility Loss in Federated Learning with Differential Privacy,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Federated learning provides the solution when multiple parties want to collaboratively train a machine learning model without directly sharing sensitive data. In Federated Learning, each party trains a machine learning model locally on its private data and sends only the modelsâ€™ weights or updates (gradients) to an aggregator, which averages locally trained models into a new global model with higher effectiveness. However, the machine learning models, which have to be shared during the federated learning process, can still leak sensitive information about their training data through e.g. membership inference attacks. Differential Privacy (DP) can mitigate privacy risks in federated learning by introducing noise into machine learning models. In this work, we consider two approaches for achieving Differential Privacy in federated learning: (i) output perturbation of the trained machine learning models and (ii) a differentially-private form of stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD).

However, at present, fuzzing testcase generation does not make full use of the information of testcases, the generation process is uncontrollable, and the generation effect is general. In view of the problems mentioned above, this paper proposes a testcase generation method based on conditional generative adversarial networks. The CWGAN-GP (Conditional Wasserstein Generic Adversarial Network-Gradient Penalty) learns the format features of testcases, and generates testcases covering corresponding branches according to the input branch information. This paper conducted experiments on 6 common programs, and the experiments showed that compared to the initial training set, testcases generated by (C)WGAN-GP can extend the exploration of the program, and thus find more vulnerabilities. The CWGAN-GP model uses the branch vector in the training set as the condition to generate testcases, which can find more crashes and hangs, and improve the final fuzzing performance.",fuzzing;branch coverage;testcase generation;one dimensional convolutions;CWGAN-GP
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Pooling Under the Sun: A Mining Pool Centralized Revisit and Solution,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Mining pools are fundamental infrastructure in most public blockchain networks that utilize Proof-of-Work consensus, ensuring that miners receive stable rewards and contribute to the computational power and storage of the network. However, mining pools also introduce centralization to the network, which increases the risk of security issues such as bribe attacks and censorship. To address the issue, this paper proposes a decentralized mining pool schema SSMP. Firstly, we distinguish between two aspects of centralization in mining pools, which are data determination, and block ownership, and suggest solutions to mitigate these issues. The proposed method utilizes anonymous broadcasting for a random leader selection schema to ensure each participating miner has an equal possibility to generate the block data. Additionally, a special threshold signature design prevents the leader miner from controlling the valid block solely of the mining pool through bribery. To validate our approach, we theoretically verify the security of the proposed method and compare it to traditional centralized mining pools. In summary, SSMP withholds the essential properties of the decentralized mining pools that maintain efficiency.",blockchain;mining pool;security;decentralization

However, maintaining the entire blockchain locally will cause heavy communication and storage overhead for users with limited resources. Alternatively, the user could act as a light node that stores block headers only and delegates queries to full nodes that maintain the entire blockchain. However, introducing a light node raises several concerns about query integrity and privacy. In this paper, we propose EPPVChain, the first scheme that simultaneously achieves efficient, privacy-preserving and verifiable conjunctive query for blockchain databases. EPPVChain resorts to a novel symmetric cryptographic primitive named Symmetric Hidden Vector Encryption (SHVE), and deploys several new techniques to achieve the desired goals. In specific, we design a new SHVE-based authenticated data structure to support privacy-preserving verifiable conjunctive queries. We further propose two improved schemes to aggregate data records to optimize query performance.

In the data marketplace, data are treated as a commodity or service, data owners can gain economic revenue by selling their data ownership or data usage rights. However, the data marketplace is facing various threats and challenges, such as unauthorized data reselling, trade of bogus data, dishonest data ownership claims, and unreasonable revenue allocation. Particularly, in the process of data resale, the revenue allocation remains a challenge when the data are processed and resold in another format. To solve this problem, we propose a revenue allocation mechanism based on the referable Non-Fungible Token (rNFT) and Shapley value method. Firstly, we tokenize the data to NFT to ensure the data ownership is traceable; Secondly, we use rNFT to record the data lineage that ensures the data owner can participate in the revenue allocation when the data are resold; Finally, we calculate the contribution of each party by the Shapley value method to ensure fairness in revenue allocation. We implement a prototype of our scheme on Ethereum and evaluate it comprehensively.

Increasingly, Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are used to this end. They embed conflict resolution strategies that take into account concurrent modifications to the policy but also to the document that it manages. However, few systems in the literature support multiple administrators, and those which do fall short of considering distributed applications where no node or group of nodes is central to its operation. To allow multiple concurrent edits of the policy in massively collaborative settings with no central server, we devise a specialized causal model that minimizes concurrency. Crucially our model allows to correct the document state in case operations have become unauthorized following a policy change.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Physical Layer Secure Communication based on MIMO Channel Constellation Flipping,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"We proposed a physical layer secure communication system for massive MIMO systems, utilizing channel entropy as the foundation. Our approach involves extracting a mask key and a flip key from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the channel matrix. The mask key ensures the protection of the flip key during transmission. By applying a random flip to the constellation diagram of the transmitted message based on the flip key, we introduce a scrambling effect that cannot be deciphered by eavesdroppers. The flip key is securely delivered to the receiver, allowing for the proper demodulation of the message by eliminating the constellation flip. To address the computational burden associated with estimating massive MIMO channels, we employ precoding of the downlink channel guide signal in the system design. This reduces the channel estimation overhead at the terminal. However, it also creates an equivalent channel for the eavesdropper, enabling them to correctly decode the precoded signal and compromise communication security. Our scheme counters this by introducing the constellation diagram flipping, which cannot be extracted by eavesdroppers, thereby preventing correct decoding. Simulation experiments confirm even with a large number of antennas, the eavesdropper is unable to completely counteract the effects of constellation flipping, thus ensuring communication security. In summary, by exploiting the singular value decomposition and employing constellation diagram flipping, our physical layer secure MIMO communication system based on channel entropy achieves secure communication even in the presence of powerful eavesdroppers.",MIMO secure communication;Precoding;Physical layer security;SVD

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Generating Synthetic Tabular Data for DDoS Detection Using Generative Models,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are a type of cyber attack that overwhelms a target server, service or network with a flood of malicious traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users. These attacks have become a major threat to the security of computer networks and systems, and effective intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are essential for detecting and mitigating these attacks. IDSs are used to monitor network traffic for malicious activity and can help detect and prevent DDoS attacks. Most IDSs are often designed to identify diverse types of attacks, but their efficacy can be limited when faced with attacks that exhibit extensive variations and sophisticated techniques, such as DDoS. In order to establish an effective IDS capable of identifying DDoS attacks, the acquisition of substantial volumes of labelled network data becomes crucial. This study aims to evaluate the performance of recent generative models in synthesising realistic tabular data to accurately emulate DDoS attack patterns. To achieve this, we used the CIC-DDOS2019 dataset, a comprehensive and modern collection of real-world DDoS attack scenarios. Leveraging state-of-the-art generative models, namely CTGAN, TVAE, and CopulaGAN, we synthesised realistic tabular data that emulated the characteristics and patterns observed in DDoS attack flow. We utilised various statistical metrics such as correlation scores, similarity and distance metrics, along with machine learning performance metrics, to quantitatively measure the performance of the generative models. The findings indicate that all three models have the ability to accurately emulate the patterns found in the real database, resulting in the generation of useful synthetic data. Specifically, among the classification methods used, the Random Forest method showed the most successful performance in detecting attacks with an accuracy of 99% when applied to the original dataset. In comparison, it achieved accuracy levels of 98%, 99%, and 93% when applied to datasets generated using the CTGAN, CopulaGAN, and TVAE models respectively. It can be concluded that generative networks have the potential to be useful in synthesising tabular data and may contribute to the overall performance of existing and future IDS.

Yet, very few DNS resolvers perform DNSSEC validation. Identifying such systems is non-trivial and the existing methods are not suitable for Internet-scale measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel remote technique for identifying DNSSEC-validating resolvers. The proposed method consists of two steps. In the first step, we identify open resolvers by scanning 3.1 billion end hosts and request every non-forwarder to resolve one correct and seven deliberately misconfigured domains. We then build a classifier that discriminates validators from non-validators based on query patterns and DNS response codes. We find that while most open resolvers are DNSSEC-enabled, less than 18% in IPv4 (38% in IPv6) validate received responses. In the second step, we remotely identify closed non-forwarders in networks that do not have inbound Source Address Validation (SAV) in place. Using the classifier built in step one, we identify 37.4% IPv4 (42.9% IPv6) closed DNSSEC validators and cross-validate the results using RIPE Atlas probes. Finally, we show that the discovered (non)-validators actively send requests to DNS root servers, suggesting that we deal with operational recursive resolvers rather than misconfigured machines.",DNS;DNSSEC;cache poisoning

TorKameleon employs K-anonymization techniques to fragment and reroute traffic through multiple TorKameleon proxies, while also utilizing covert WebRTC-based channels or TLS tunnels to encapsulate user traffic.",Censorship Circumvention;Tor;Traffic Encapsulation;WebRTC;Traffic Correlation Attacks;K-anonymization
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,A Dynamic Network-based Intrusion Detection Model for Industrial Control Systems,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Industrial Control Systems (ICS) play a crucial role in managing and controlling industrial assets. Due to their critical importance, adversaries are often highly motivated to target these systems, as a successful attack can disrupt the entire industryâ€™s operations. In general, to improve the systemâ€™s security, proposed intrusion detection schemes often resort to traditional security mechanisms. As a consequence, due to their static nature, attackers can easily evade designed detection approaches. In light of this, this paper proposes a new dynamic network-based intrusion detection model for ICS, implemented in two phases. First, our scheme extracts network-related features to describe the current ICS environment behavior. Second, the security mechanisms are proactively selected based on the extracted network traffic behavior. As a result, our scheme can adjust the systemâ€™s configuration based on the current assessed event. Experiments on a new dataset, featuring over 14 attack categories targeting a SCADA system revealed that traditional detection methods face challenges in handling diverse attack categories. Conversely, our proposed model improved the average true-positive rates by up to 20% while also improving the range of detected attacks.",SCADA;Industrial Control Systems;Machine Learning
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Attacks Against Mobility Prediction in 5G Networks,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"The 5th generation of mobile networks introduces a new Network Function (NF) that was not present in previous generations, namely the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF). Its primary objective is to provide advanced analytics services to various entities within the network and also towards external application services in the 5G ecosystem. One of the key use cases of NWDAF is mobility trajectory prediction, which aims to accurately support efficient mobility management of User Equipment (UE) in the network by allocating ""just in time"" necessary network resources. In this paper, we show that there are potential mobility attacks that can compromise the accuracy of these predictions. In a semi-realistic scenario with 10,000 subscribers, we demonstrate that an adversary equipped with the ability to hijack cellular mobile devices and clone them can significantly reduce the prediction accuracy from 75% to 40% using just 100 adversarial UEs. While a defense mechanism largely depends on the attack and the mobility types in a particular area, we prove that a basic KMeans clustering is effective in distinguishing legitimate and adversarial UEs.",NWDAF;5G;mobility prediction;adversarial mobility

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Securing Zero Trust Networks: the Decentralized Host-to-Host Authentication Policy Enforcement,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Zero trust networks have emerged as a promising solution to assure comprehensive security in network environments. Different from the traditional perimeter-based security approach, zero trust networks provide a robust and adaptable security framework which addresses the evolving threat landscape and enables organizations to protect their critical assets with a higher assurance of confidence. However, the centralized policy engine employed in current zero trust architectures (ZTA) would introduce bottlenecks and single points of failure (SPoF) for ZTA-based networks, thus hindering the scalability and efficiency as network size increases. This paper introduces a novel decentralized host-to-host authentication schema that enables consistent policy engine decisions in a pair-wise manner. By decentralizing the authentication process, the proposed schema effectively eliminates bottlenecks and single points of failure associated with centralized policy engines. The system incorporates a decentralized authentication ledger and a policy validation protocol to ensure the correct and consistent authentication across all network hosts. Through comprehensive tests and simulations, we compared our proposed novel model with the traditional zero trust network, in terms of the correctness, time complexity, and efficiency. Our findings demonstrate the advantages of our decentralized approach and its potential for enhancing security in zero trust networks.",Zero-trust;Authentication;Security;Blockchain

Most of the machine learning based intrusion detection systems proposed earlier, to mitigate these attacks, consider training a model for the group of attacks, which doesnâ€™t consider protocol-specific properties into account and is biased toward attacks where most of the data is available. In this paper, we propose protocol aware unsupervised method based on an autoencoder-based learning approach to detect the attack in network flows by training the model using only normal traffic and using reconstruction error as the parameter to classify the attack event. Our proposed method is based on building protocol aware model by combining individual protocol-specific encoders and learning the protocol channel importance using attention mechanism.

However, there are two thorny problems caused by the characteristics of intrusion data: ""multi-type features"" and ""data imbalance"". The former means that forcefully and improperly transforming intrusion features from distinct metric spaces can result in semantic loss and noise. The latter indicates that the intrusion data is imbalanced in quantity and quality due to its complex spatial distribution. We propose a Hybrid Framework for Multi-type and Imbalance Data (HF-Mid) to address the above two problems. Firstly, we divide the intrusion features into equivalent and non-equivalent groups, and then embed them sequentially using Supervised Paragraph Vector-Distributed Memory (SPV-DM), which excels at modeling co-occurrence relationships, and Deep Neural Network (DNN), which is suitable for modeling non-linear relationships, thereby solving the ""multitype features"" problem. Secondly, we adopt a low-noise collective matrix factorization (CMF) model to fuse the two obtained features for dimensionality reduction. Finally, we employ a multiple classifier to detect intrusion. During the classifier training stage, we design a genetic algorithm-based proportional sampling method to select high-quality samples in each training batch. thus addressing the ""data imbalance"" problem.

The harm caused by deepfake includes spreading false information, pornography, financial fraud, privacy breaches, and security system damage. To address these security issues, it is necessary to strengthen the detection and defense of deepfake. Current research mainly focuses on the detection of deepfake images and videos. In recent years, some work has proposed using the method of generating adversarial samples to deal with the malicious operations of GAN networks in deepfake. And it has proposed different single perturbation fusion methods to generate universal adversarial watermarks that can defend against modifications by multiple models. However, all of these works generate single-step watermarks using gradient-based methods, which cannot accurately control the required perturbation strength, resulting in large errors and more irrelevant information compared to the original image after superimposing the watermark. To solve this problem, we propose an optimized adversarial face deepfake watermark and measure the protection success rate and defense performance of this method on single and multiple models. From the extensive experimental results, we find that the perturbation generated by the Optimization-based method can successfully generate smaller perturbations while ensuring a high protection success rate, making the adversarial samples closer to the original samples. It can also be applied to different types of models and loss functions, accurately generating perturbation strength, and has a wider range of applicability.",watermarks;adversarial examples;face deepfake;generative adversarial networks

The majority of previous schemes of document similarity search share the same limitation: they focus mainly on static collections. Dynamic searchable schemes (DSE) allow adding or removing documents at the expense of more leakage than static schemes. To thwart certain attacks, DSE schemes should support forward privacy property, which ensures that newly added documents cannot be related to previously issued search queries.

Even though new protocols are considering built-in security (e.g. OPC UA) there is still a struggle for assuring interoperability and interconnectivity in the IoT era while dealing with resource constrained devices. This paper attempts to implement and evaluate a solution for assuring the authenticity and integrity of the data transmitted through OPC UA protocol in a client- server communication based on ECC as an alternative to the existing implemented solution which uses RSA. We choose ECC since it can achieve similar level of security as RSA for smaller key size and in order to respond to the limited memory and resource constrained elements part of an industrial system. Furthermore, we aim to evaluate through measurements the performance of different ECC key sizes in respect to the latency introduced by each cryptographic operation.",ECC;ECDSA;security;OPC UA;Industrial Internet of Things - IoT

At the same time, the presence of sensors and other devices around us has created a leaky ecology that is webbed. It has turned into a risk for the users and causes worry about how widely it could be adopted. Numerous projects have been put up in a similar vein, creating innovations to improve security. But, conventional cryptographic solutions are difficult to embed as these IoT devices have limited resources. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs), particularly in resource-restraining devices, have shown to be valuable for developing authentication protocols. In this work, we propose a PUF-based authentication mechanism for IoT devices. This authentication protocol also performs the key exchange between the two nodes, with the server in between. The security features of the proposed mechanism are verified using AVISPA tool.",IoT Security;Authentication;Physical Unclonable Function (PUF)
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Practical Privacy-Preserving Ride Sharing Protocol with Symmetric Key,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"The advancement of mobile technologies and their ability to utilize the Global Positioning System (GPS) to accurately locate their substantial number of users, prompt Location-Based Services (LBS) significantly. Ride-sharing is a popular means of transportation that utilizes LBS. With the rapid development of smart cities and their impact on addressing the critical issues of urban life such as transportation, we can safely assume that the autonomous vehicles (AVs) will be a desired way of transportation in the near future. Therefore, the ride sharing service (RSS) providers will need to arrange their services via AVs. However, a user who wants to use a RSS has to submit their trip data (which contains location data) to the service provider. On one hand, the popularity of RSSs makes them an attractive target for cyber-attacks, and on the other hand, multiple studies show that a userâ€™s location data can reveal sensitive information about that user. In this paper, we present a practical ride-sharing protocol for AVs that preserves both anonymity and location privacy of the users. Most of the previous works on the topic, does not provide security against malicious server and/or clients. Moreover, the previously proposed protocols rely on additional entities (e.g., a trusted third party) to satisfy the objectives of their protocols. In the presence of the malicious entities, our proposed protocol guarantees the security and privacy of the server and the clients, without relying on any additional parties. To the best of our knowledge, our protocol is the first scheme that satisfies perfect location privacy. We evaluate the performance of our protocol in a realistic setting and demonstrate its feasibility in the real life application areas, i.e., the protocol only requires 20 milliseconds to process and respond to 1000 simultaneous ride-sharing requests. Moreover, we propose a novel private sum aggregation (PSA) scheme that is designed for the use-cases where the private elements are chosen from a limited set. We believe that our novel PSA scheme may be of independent interest.",Ride sharing services;Location privacy;Privacy-enhancing technologies;Autonomous vehicle;Smart city;Secret sharing;Symmetric key;Private aggregation
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,EMD-SCS: A Dynamic Behavioral Approach for Early Malware Detection with Sonification of System Call Sequences,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"The privacy and security of users are increasingly threatened due to the rising frequency of malware assaults. Both Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDSes) and Antivirus software rely on signature-based or anomaly-based techniques for malware detection. However, the escalating diversity and sophistication of malware pose significant obstacles. In this research, we introduce EMD-SCS, an early malware detection methodology, employing sonification and system call sequence analysis. In our methodology, we interpret an executing program/process as a sequence of system calls, leveraging a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) to hold a record of preceding system calls within this chain, consequently facilitating the prediction of future calls. After this prediction phase, the BLEU and hamming distance scores are utilized to classify the system call sequence. Importantly, these results are attained by analyzing just a small segment of the data for early prediction, which is crucial for a sonification-based approach as it enables us to notify administrators in advance of potential threats. This early warning system would allow admins to protect the host before a potential compromise. EMD-SCS uses sonification to convey the prediction outcomes using natural and animal sounds, offering a broader monitoring scope than visual observation. Evaluation results from the ADFA-LD dataset suggest that EMD-SCS surpasses prior techniques in early malware detection with an accuracy of 91.2%, a detection rate of 87.7%, and a false-positive rate of 15.3%, achieved by only processing 40% of the input system call sequences before they infiltrate the host.",Early Anomaly Detection;Behavioral-based malware detection;Long Short-Term Memory network;System Call Analysis;Sonification
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,On the Adoption of Homomorphic Encryption by Financial Institutions*,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Financial institutions collect, control and process sensitive data, either personally or commercially. These data are vital for many purposes, including business process optimisation, tailored services to individuals and organisations, and preventing fraud or other misuse of the financial system. While an institutionâ€™s information is valuable, its power is amplified when combined with other data stored in different organisations horizontally, vertically or in a governance role. However, sharing data between organisations becomes difficult for commercial, legal and regulatory reasons. Privacy-enhancing Technologies (PETs) are becoming a practical solution for secure and private information sharing. One such PET, Homomorphic Encryption (HE), allows the computation over encrypted data and thus protects the confidentiality of the information while increasing its utility. This paper investigates the current position regarding the use of HE in the financial sector by analysing the LexisNexis news archive using statistical instruments on NLP and ML techniques. Our results show that the financial sector has gained momentum in discussing privacy-enhancing technology over the last few years.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Anomaly based malware threat detection on Linux Systems,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"There has been a steady increase in malware targeting Linux-based systems. With the proliferation of embedded IoT devices and cloud architectures that use Linux or Unix-based Operating Systems, this trend is expected to grow. Most modern Linux distributions include a configurable and queryable userspace component for security auditing with auditd (audit daemon) subsystem. In a multi-user, enterprise environment, these audit events are typically collected in a centralized repository as a source for threat detection and Incident response. Attack techniques used by malicious programs such as process injection and memory corruption are commonly seen in fileless malware, insider threats, and zero day attacks. Such attacks are difficult to detect through traditional signature-based methods since there are no known, discernible indicators of compromise. This study proposes a novel method of using Linux process overlay (execve) audit logs to identify threats from malicious executable and shellcode, with Machine Learning. Our study proposes a methodology that uses a Sparse Autoencoder Deep Learning model to effectively detect these security threats as anomalies, with an accuracy of over 95 percent. We suggest this approach as a feasible enterprise solution to identify Linux malware and detect security threat anomalies by leveraging native Linux audit logging capabilities.",Linux malware;Anomaly detection;Linux audit logs

Hard drives face mechanical failures and data fragmentation, but their sequential storage and higher success rates make recovery more feasible. Solid State Drives (SSDs), with no moving parts and no data fragmentation, provide faster access to data but may pose challenges due to wear levelling and data retention issues. This project examines the challenges of data recovery between hard drives and solid-state media and compares them against each other. This was achieved by running several tests on four types of storage media, one of which is a hard drive, and the others are different types of solid-state media. The tests indicated that most SSDs perform as expected; however, the Intel Optane drive retained a much higher percentage of deleted data than the other drives. Despite this, all of the evaluated SSDs retained less deleted data than the hard drive. It can therefore be argued that traditional forensic processes are incapable of recovering as much deleted data from solid-state media and that these processes must be re-examined.",Data Recovery;Hard Drive;Solid State Drive;Forensics Analysis

At the same time, however, trustworthiness assurance is becoming extremely difficult in these complex ecosystems due to the high autonomy, unpredictability and limited controllability of their individual players. To mitigate safety risks for humans, these Dynamic Autonomous Ecosystems (e.g., Smart Cities) might require their member systems (e.g., Autonomous Vehicles) to execute software modules called Smart Agents to ensure safe coordination among themselves. Unfortunately, this technology is currently in its very early development with many challenges ahead. Namely, there is no guaranteed way of ensuring that these agents run on the right piece of hardware, with the right privileges required to fulfill their roles, and without the execution environment tampering with their instructions. This way, the host system (e.g., the Autonomous Vehicle we need to control for the sake of the safety of other ecosystem members) can escape the actual safety measures to be enforced. In this paper, we are proposing a novel software architecture that focuses on the detection of instruction tampering and privileged access in Smart Agents, and this way support the vision of trustworthy and safe evolution of Dynamic Autonomous Ecosystems.",trust;autonomous systems;autonomous ecosystems;trusted execution;blockchain

Hence users should be careful not to post content with unacceptable privacy risks. In order to correctly determine whether a privacy risk is acceptable, the perceived privacy risk must match the actual privacy risk. One of the objectives of this study is to investigate whether the recognition of privacy risk is consistent with the actual privacy risk. This study investigates the posters â€™recognition of privacy risk from postings that infer their attributes and regrets about their actions. On the other hand, privacy information can also be leaked from other peopleâ€™s posts, to which people respond with ""Liking"" or ""Retweeting."" Existing methods for analyzing their posts to suppress their posts may not be effective if personal information is leaked from the responses to the contents of othersâ€™ posts. In addition, users may be less likely to perceive the risk of privacy information leakage from responses to the contents of others â€™ posts than from their posts. Therefore, this study tests the hypothesis that there is a difference between the usersâ€™ recognition of privacy risk in posting by themselves and that caused by responding to contents of othersâ€™ posts and evaluates the difficulty of recognizing privacy risk caused by responding compared with that by posting.",Privacy;SNS

Trust management, by evaluating the trustworthiness of entities and the trust relationships between entities, aims to identify false messages, detect malicious nodes, and maintain network security. Compared to other security techniques, trust management places more emphasis on entity behavior and motives. This paper quantifies entity trustworthiness using weighted Beta distributions and detects malicious nodes based on this quantification. To comprehensively assess the trust status of entities, four conditions are designed to collect detailed information about the entities and their surrounding environment. Each condition forms a Beta distribution, and the weighted sum of these four conditionsâ€™ distributions represents the entityâ€™s trustworthiness value. The paper also analyzes the weight allocation and resistance to malicious attacks of the proposed trust evaluation mechanism, providing corresponding countermeasures against attacks. Furthermore, simulation experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

Therefore, the pursuit of a unified resource authorization management system is necessary. Most widely used authorization systems are based on centralized services with a single delegation pattern. These authorization systems can be easily compromised, leading to permissions tampering, and are unsuitable for complex usage scenarios. We propose a decentralized authorization system that provides flexible delegation called FlexAuth. We first define a decentralized data storage layer based on blockchain, using smart contracts to implement data writing and resolving, preventing data from being tampered with. On top of this, we implement active and passive delegation patterns of authorization services. We allow users to delegate permissions actively. Also, FlexAuth enables them to respond to authorization requests passively by making flexible and expressive access control policies based on relation-ships and attributes, using the proposed Hybrid Access Control Model (HACM). Furthermore, all delegations in FlexAuth are transitive. Finally, through analysis and experiments, we validate the usability and efficiency of FlexAuth.

However, the increasing complexity of CPS and their deployment in highly dynamic contexts undermine user trust. This motivates the investigation of methods capable of generating explanations about the behavior of CPS. To this end, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies show potential. However, these approaches do not consider contextual variables that a CPS may be subjected to (e.g., temperature, humidity), and the provided explanations are typically not actionable. In this article, we propose an Actionable Contextual Explanation System (ACES) that considers such contextual influences. Based on a user query about a behavioral attribute of a CPS (for example, vibrations and speed), ACES creates contextual explanations for the behavior of such a CPS considering its context. To generate contextual explanations, ACES uses a context model to discover sensors and actuators in the physical environment of a CPS and obtains time-series data from these devices. It then cross-correlates these time-series logs with the user-specified behavioral attribute of the CPS. Finally, ACES employs a counterfactual explanation method and takes user feedback to identify causal relationships between the contextual variables and the behavior of the CPS. We demonstrate our approach with a synthetic use case; the favorable results obtained, motivate the future deployment of ACES in real-world scenarios.",explainability;cyber-physical systems;knowledge graph;reasoning;context;XAI

In addition, the corrupt sensor data may also affect the machine learning models by introducing false training data or biasing the model towards certain decisions to cause the autonomous system to make incorrect decisions. The existing techniques mostly perform memory attestation or ensure the secure execution of an application. In addition, current approaches have unrealistic assumptions about adversariesâ€™ capabilities and rely on trusted parties to initiate and run the attestation protocol. No existing technique provides all the required security features, including protection against return-oriented programming and network attacks, including interference, rainbow, and physical compromise.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Stealthy Rootkits vs Low-Power IoT Devices: A Process-level Colonel Blotto Game,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Kernel-level rootkits are considered stealthy malware versions that can target Internet of Things (IoT) devices as part of large-scale Advanced Persistent Threats. These can gain root privileges and easily hide their attack traces within the system. Several rootkit detection approaches have been proposed, but they lack the consideration of power resource limitation on battery-based edge devices. To address these limitations, this paper models the interaction between stealthy malware and the deviceâ€™s anomaly detection algorithm as a Colonel Blotto game in order to produce the set of mixed strategies that optimize the allocation of security resources dedicated to monitoring kernel-level processes and detecting abnormal system calls while preserving device power. We present the models for both versions of the game, static and dynamic, to reflect a realistic deployment scenario. The preliminary numerical results show that the strategic resource allocation enabled by the proposed game model achieves better security compared to non-strategic scenarios that do not consider the attackerâ€™s resource budget.",IoT security;stealthy malware;rootkit detection;game theory;strategic defense;Nash equilibrium

Therefore, Long Term Evolution for Railway (LTE-R) begin to replace Global System for Mobile Communications for Railway (GSM-R) to burden the core wireless communication services. In order to improve the operation and maintenance efficiency of LTE-R network, this paper proposes a multi-step LTE-R communication quality prediction method based on Differential Evolution algorithm and Temporal Convolutional Network with Coordinate Attention (TCNCA). Firstly, this method uses differential evolution and permutation importance index to filter the features of multivariate LTE-R communication quality data. Then, the coordinate attention mechanism and TCN network were fused to build the prediction model. Finally, this method still used Differential Evolution to adjust the model parameters based on Mannâ€”Kendall test, so that the model could take into account the prediction accuracy and the trend of data change, thus realize the multi-step prediction for LTE-R communication quality.

The current masquerader detection techniques usually rely on the fact that the masquerader is an outsider, making them unable to detect attacks from the traitor.

Network Traffic Features are the critical input for AI-based network traffic classification. However, unlike images and natural language traffic, features have high dispersion and weak stability. On the one hand, part of the key numerical flow features have a wide range of values. By scaling the features, the model can be better trained, which allows the classifier to make more accurate predictions. On the other hand, edge networks cannot scale features as well as the training set in the cloud. This situation affects the modelâ€™s performance on edge devices. This paper proposes a novel processing method of flow features for the AI-based network traffic classification model using cloud-edge collaboration. The method leverages the strong computational power of cloud computing to scale the flow features and transmit parameters derived from feature scaling to edge networks.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Multi-Granularity Cross-Attention Network for Visual Question Answering,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a recent hot topic that involves multimedia analysis, computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and even a broad perspective of artificial intelligence, which is challenging and has obtained increasing attention. VQA needs a complete understanding of the spatial relationship, textual clues, as well as the common sense for an actual image. However, most existing approaches simply embed and concatenate the features of questions and images to predict answers. Treating all embeddings equally without consideration of relation consistency hinders the model performance. In this paper, we propose an explicit Multi-Granularity Cross-Attention network (MGCAN) that mutually learns the multi-modal branches. MGCAN jointly matches word-level representation with whole image, and patch-level representation with the whole question that infers the high-order vision-semantic relationship. Experiments conducted on VQA datasets demonstrate that the proposed MGCAN outperforms previous baselines. The cross-attention mechanism explicitly exploits the relevant visual and textual clues that lead to superior prediction.",Multimedia Analysis;Visual Question Answering;Deep Learning;Attention

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Vulnerability Name Prediction Based on Enhanced Multi-Source Domain Adaptation,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Software products have brought convenience to modern society but also pose significant security risks due to various types of vulnerabilities. Identifying vulnerability names is vital for program repair and software maintenance, but the lack of training data presents a challenge. Big data analytics and machine learning can help overcome this challenge by processing large amounts of data and improving the accuracy of vulnerability name prediction. Considering that the data is often from datasets composed of multiple sources, a feature-based or attention-based multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) approach is required. In this paper, we propose an MSDA method based on both feature and attention to accomplish the task of predicting vulnerability names, called Multi-Source Domain Adaptation for Vulnerability Name Prediction (MSDA-VNP). First, MSDA-VNP reduces domain divergence by adversarial training and then uses domain-invariant features to obtain feature correlations between individual source and target domains. In combination with the obtained domain correlations, Weighted multi-kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (WMK-MMD) is proposed as the attention mechanism. Second, a data augmentation strategy is employed to enhance MSDA-VNP to identify privacy-related vulnerabilities. To evaluate our approach, we conducted experiments on eight Java real-world projects in the Software Assurance Reference Dataset (SARD). The experimental results show that the proposed method MSDA-VNP performed efficiently and stably for the 44 types of vulnerabilities involved. The data augmentation strategy has also been proved to be effective as an enhancement for the proposed method MSDA-VNP.",vulnerability name prediction;multi-source domain adaptation;data augmentation;adversarial training;attention mechanism

These technologies serve to optimize the planning and operation of communication networks and enhance the quality of network services, thereby providing powerful support for the provision of social public services, urban planning, and emergency management. The existing user address localization methods used by operators mainly rely on base stations locations and user-reported GPS. However, when the coverage area of a base station is too large, the localization accuracy will be poor even if triangulation techniques are used. Moreover, since the user-reported GPS is triggered by specific network events, its time continuity and volume are unstable. To address these limitations, this paper provides a user address localization method based on data fusion of signaling data from core network, measurement report (MR) data from radio access network, and operational data from carriersâ€™ business support system (BSS). The feature engineering is performed from three dimensions, including base station level analysis, GPS level analysis, and address level analysis, to construct a building-level user address localization model. During data fusion, the signaling data compensates the weak time continuity of MR data, and the MR data compensates the poor localization accuracy of signaling data.

SDN is revolutionizing traditional network architecture by significantly reducing the reliance on hardware. One of the key challenges of implementing SDN in NG-IoT is the extensive communication that occurs between the switches and the controllers due to the bursty nature of the traffic. Therefore, it is crucial to explore solutions aimed at minimizing this control overhead caused by excessive communication. To alleviate the burden on SDN controllers caused by switches, we propose a new method, named LSDA, which can effectively reduce the flow of control information. To promote fairness within the network, packets heading towards the same controller are aggregated, thereby eliminating the need for complex disassembly in the case of different destination controllers. The simulation results demonstrate that LSDA can effectively reduce the packet loss ratio while simultaneously improving network delay and jitter.",Control overhead;Internet of Things;Packet Aggregation;SDN

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Fast Text Classification using Lean Gradient Descent Feed Forward Neural Network for Category Feature Augmentation,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Text classification is a key task of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field that aims at assigning predefined categories to textual documents. Performing text classification requires features that effectively represent the content and the meaning of textual documents. Selecting a suitable method for term weighting is of central importance and can improve the quality of the classification method. In this paper, we propose to a new text classification solution to perform Category-based Feature Augmentation (CFA) on the document representation. First, a term-category feature matrix is derived from a modified version of the supervised Term-Frequency Inverse-Category-Frequency (TF-ICF) weighting model. This is done by embedding the TF-ICF matrix in a one-layer feed-forward neural network. The latter is trained using the gradient descent algorithm allowing to iteratively update the term-category matrix until reaching convergence. The model produces category-based feature vector representations that are used to augment the document representations and perform the classification task.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Histopathological Image Classification and Vulnerability Analysis using Federated Learning,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Healthcare is one of the foremost applications of machine learning (ML). Traditionally, ML models are trained by central servers, which aggregate data from various distributed devices to forecast the results for newly generated data. This is a major concern as models can access sensitive user information, which raises privacy concerns. A federated learning (FL) approach can help address this issue: A global model sends its copy to all clients who train these copies, and the clients send the updates (weights) back to it. Over time, the global model improves and becomes more accurate. Data privacy is protected during training, as it is conducted locally on the clientsâ€™ devices.However, the global model is susceptible to data poisoning. We develop a privacy-preserving FL technique for a skin cancer dataset and show that the model is prone to data poisoning attacks. Ten clients train the model, but one of them intentionally introduces flipped labels as an attack. This reduces the accuracy of the global model. As the percentage of label flipping increases, there is a noticeable decrease in accuracy. We use a stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithm to find the most optimal accuracy for the model. Although FL can protect user privacy for healthcare diagnostics, it is also vulnerable to data poisoning, which must be addressed.",Healthcare;Federated learning;Deep neural network;Label flipping;Data poisoning
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,High-Performance Object Serialization based on Ahead-of-Time Schema Generation,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Many of todayâ€™s Big Data systems are developed in the Java programming language and require fast object serialization and deserialization for efficient and high-speed message exchange. We address this by introducing Skema, a library providing high-performance serialization of Java objects. Skema works based on Ahead-of-Time schema generation, so that only a minimal number of operations need to be performed at runtime to serialize an object. This approach allows Skema to also serialize individual objects only partially which is a great advantage for network communications with fixed buffer sizes. Furthermore, targeted optimizations, such as caching the size of the serialized form of objects that have a fixed size so that they do not have to be recomputed for each operation, are presented. In addition to a more in-depth explanation of the implemented procedures, this paper also presents benchmark results comparing the Skema library against Kryo, FST and the native Java serialization function. The results of these experiments achieve very good values in comparison with the remaining libraries. For example, one experiment shows that there can be nearly a hundredfold increase in the speed of deserializing objects when compared to the native Java serialization mechanism by using Skema. We also show that deserializing objects using the native Java mechanism requires a large amount of additional memory per operation, which puts a burden on the garbage collector afterwards. Finally, to investigate the scalability of the implemented solution, the benchmarks are also performed using different numbers of threads and the results are presented graphically.",Java;Serialization;Native;High-Performance

A fast fluid antenna multiple access (f-FAMA) system uses a large antenna array at the base station to transmit each userâ€™s signal from each antenna. The interference is then overcome by a single fluid antenna located at each receiving UD. Previous work has established a channel model for such a f-FAMA system with a technique that estimates the best port for the fluid antenna to receive the signal at every symbol instance. This paper proposes an improved version of the channel model by also taking into consideration the difference in path loss between different ports and also looks into how different fluid antenna architectures effect the performance of an f-FAMA system. Simulation results demonstrate the necessity of considering path loss variations, particularly in scenarios where there are substantial differences in distances from the transmitter to different ports. Additionally, among the three different antenna architectures considered, the performance of the wheel topology antenna is worse than the linear topology and circular topology antennas at shorter reference distances.",6G;Fluid antenna;Multiple Access;Performance Analysis;Path Loss;Antenna Architecture

However, this approach fails to effectively leverage the potential of all structures within each layer of the network. In order to comprehensively consider the various structures in each layer, we propose a novel method called Soft Hybrid Filter Pruning using a Dual Ranking Approach (DR-SHFP), which builds upon Soft Filter Pruning (SFP) by introducing a dual-ranking approach. DR-SHFP incorporates a ranking system that assigns a rank to each filter in a collaborative manner, taking into account both convolutional layers and batch normalization layers. By simultaneously evaluating both types of layers, our method captures more information from the layer structures, overcoming the limitations of single-structure evaluation. Consequently, DR-SHFP can identify and select filters more effectively for pruning, leading to improved performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DR-SHFP on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Dynamic Split Computing-Aware Mixed-Precision Quantization for Efficient Deep Edge Intelligence,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Deploying large deep neural networks (DNNs) on IoT and mobile devices poses a significant challenge due to hardware resource limitations. To address this challenge, an edge-cloud integration technique, called split computing (SC), is attractive in improving the inference time by splitting a single DNN model into two sub-models to be processed on an edge device and a server. Dynamic split computing (DSC) is a further emerging technique in SC to dynamically determine the split point depending on the communication conditions. In this work, we propose a DNN architecture optimization method for DSC. Our contributions are twofold. (1) First, we develop a DSC-aware mixed-precision quantization method exploiting neural architecture search (NAS). By NAS, we efficiently explore the optimal bitwidth of each layer from a huge design space to construct potential split points in the target DNN â€“ with the more potential split points, the DNN architecture can more flexibly utilize one split point depending on the communication conditions. (2) Also, in order to improve the end-to-end inference time, we propose a new bitwidth-wise DSC (BW-DSC) algorithm to dynamically determine the optimal split point among the potential split points in the mixed-precision quantized DNN architecture. Our evaluation demonstrated that our work provides more effective split points than existing works while mitigating the inference accuracy degradation. Specifically in terms of the end-to-end inference time, our work achieved an average of 16.47% and up to 24.36% improvement compared with a state-of-the-art work.",Deep Neural Networks;Split Computing;Mixed-Precision Quantization;Neural Architecture Search

The previous edge server placement strategy can not be directly applied to deploying vehicle networking services, resulting in the degradation of system performance and user quality of experience. To solve the above problem, we propose a reliable edge server deployment algorithm called CFD based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG).

Then, the fuzzy C clustering algorithm (FCM) is leveraged to remove the ""noise"" and acquire the roadside unitsâ€™ initial division and priority matrix. Finally, based on the DDPG algorithm, the optimal division of roadside units is obtained, and the cluster center is utilized as the deployment location of the edge server.

Existing prediction models can be divided into two categories: non-machine learning models and machine learning models. Nonmachine learning models excessively rely on historical data, while machine learning models have high time complexity and require large amounts of data. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a spatial distance optimization-based model for predicting pollutant concentration. The proposed model uses a neural network for predicting pollutant concentration, with the nonlinear activation increasing the model's ability to fit nonlinear data. Additionally, it proposes a spatial distance optimization strategy that divides the surrounding monitoring stations based on their distance from the target station. As the neural network model deepens, the influence of more distant monitoring stations on the predicted values gradually reduces. The proposed model adapts the weights based on training errors, implicitly learning the distribution of the relationship between station distances and concentration values and fully exploiting the intrinsic information of the data.

However, they do not consider the potentially different level of security of links in the network. In this work, we propose an approach for Flow Admission and Routing under Minimal Security Constraints (FARSec) in Software Defined Networks, where network flows must use links which are at least as secure as their required security level. We prove that FARSec can find feasible paths respecting the minimum level of security for each flow. If the latter is not possible FARSec rejects the flow in order not to compromise its security.

Personalized recommendation has gained its popularity as it provides recommendations according to the user profile, preferences and/or interests. Many existing systems make recommendation by centralizing data. However, the exposure of sensitive data raises a privacy concern as research has shown that it is possible to de-identify anonymous users. Examples include inferring sensitive information (e.g., political views, sexual orientations) from non-sensitive data (e.g., movie ratings). In this paper, we present a personalized privacy-preserving recommendation system called Trust-based Agent Network (TAN). It tackles the privacy issue by semi-decentralizing data and treating each node in the network as an agent. As such, data are distributed to each agent within each trusted network, and the recommendation service provider collects only obfuscated data from agents by adopting the differential-privacy mechanism. Consequently, data in our TAN are either protected inside local trusted networks or obfuscated outside of trusted networks. Final recommendation can then be made by aggregating the local suggestions from the trusted network and obfuscated global suggestions from the service provider. Personalized recommendations can be made by putting more emphasize on local suggestions. Evaluation results show that our TAN leads to high accuracy and highly personalized recommendations while protecting privacy.",Recommendation system;Personalization;Collaborative filtering;Semi-centralized;Trusted network;Privacy preservation;Ubiquitous computing

To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel deep learning model known as the Permutable Hybrid Zipped Network (PHZNet), which is specifically tailored for classifying patient responses to Immune Checkpoint Blockade (ICB) therapy. We achieved 89.67% accuracy on the transcriptomics public dataset from the Faculty of Pharmacy, Universit'e de Montr'eal, outperforming other excellent models. In addition, to explore interpretability, based on the concept of model distillation, we propose to use XGBoost gradient boosting decision trees to distill PHZNet and thus uncovering key gene features influencing therapy response. Our study provides a reliable basis for clinical decision-making by predicting whether patient benefits from ICB therapy across pan-cancer. Furthermore, it paves the way for understanding the ICB treatment response mechanism and provides critical gene targets for future immune treatment strategies.",Immune Checkpoint Blockade (ICB) therapy;Deep learning model;Transcriptomics;Pan-cancer
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,An Instruction Inference Graph Optimal Transport Network Model For Biomedical Commonsense Question Answering,"TrustCom - International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",B,"Biomedical commonsense question answering is a challenging learning task that aims to give correct answers to biomedical commonsense questions. Many works have used rule-based or deep learning approachs to accomplish this task. Recently, an extensive research path is that pre-trained language models combined with graph neural networks (GNNs) to improve the accuracy of biomedical commonsense question answering. However, GNN is prone to the over-smoothing problem, causing the models to lose the ability to reason. In order to alleviate the over-smoothing problem and improve the inference ability for biomedical commonsense question answering, we propose a new end-to-end model named BiomGIN. In BiomGIN, we introduce the Graph Optimal Transport Networks (GOTNet) to use node-centroid attention to capture non-local messages in the knowledge graph, which alleviates the model over-smoothing problem. In addition, we design a question parsing module based on Transformer to generate linguistic instructions, which enhances the inference capability of the GNN. Finally, we evaluated our model on MedQA-USMLE dataset to compare with other baseline models. The experimental results demonstrate the method proposed in this paper achieves state-of-the-art results.",Biomedical Commonsense Question Answering;Large Pre-trained Language Model;Graph Neural Network;Knowledge Graph;Graph Optimal Transport Network;Question Parsing

This paper introduces a novel graph convolutional network, denoted as Semantic Dependency and Aspect Interaction Graph Convolutional Network(SDAIGCN), to overcome the limitations of existing graph-based sentiment analysis models in handling the semantic intricacies within aspectual phrases and the sentiment interactions among different aspects in a sentence. The SDAIGCN model achieves this by incorporating internal semantic correlations among aspect phrases through syntactic dependencies between context and aspect words in a sentence. Additionally, it associates affective interactions among different aspects to generate four types of adjacency matrix graphs. Experimental results on four publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed model yields improvements in both accuracy and F1 score.",Aspect-level sentiment analysis;graph convolutional networks;syntactic dependency trees

Many transcriptome prediction methods have achieved good accuracy from genetic variation data. However, these traditional transcriptome prediction methods have the problems of linear assumption, overfitting, expose personal privacy, and extensive manual optimization. To solve these shortcomings, we propose an attention-based transcriptome prediction model from genetic variation named RATPM that improves the accuracy of transcriptome prediction and protects participant genomic data. In RATPM, we introduce and improve the deep learning model with multi-head self-attention into the transcriptome prediction stage of Predixcan, which uncovers the non-linear relationship between genetic variation and transcriptome. Moreover, we introduce a residual attention module to generate attention-aware features and extract more accurate features at different levels from genetic variation. Furthermore, we introduce the BERT pre-training module to encode genetic variation fully utilizing their contextual information. Our research enables scientific institutions to publish only predicted transcriptomic data for biometric purposes, thus protecting the genomic information of the subjects. Finally, we evaluated our model on the 1000 Genomes and Geuvadis projects datasets to compare with other baseline models.",Transcriptome Prediction;Genetic Variation;Residual Attention Network;BERT Pre-training

Some deep learning models have achieved expert-level accuracy on some medical datasets, but these models are rarely used in clinical practice due to the lack of interpretability. Therefore, the research topic of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged to make the reasoning process of the model transparent and interpretable. In this case, we applied interpretable artificial intelligence to dermatoscopy image diagnosis for the first time. Specifically, we use an interpretable prototype network for dermoscopy image diagnosis. To solve the problem of weak generalization performance of a single network, we propose to construct a new prototype network using the dual-path network. Besides, we propose a new gate similarity calculation method to reduce the activation of low-similarity regions, thereby reducing the generation of inaccurate prototypes and improving the diagnostic ability of the model. We conducted experiments on the dermoscopy datasets HAM10000 to test the model and compare it with other baseline models.

Such integrity assurances can then be used to implement a secure end-to-end encryption application built in the form of a website. Our framework encompasses developers, the Domain Name System, and web browsers. To accomplish the integrity guarantees, our framework makes use of an index of queryable URLs and allowed redirects for the website, and publishes the cryptographic hash value of the index in the DNS. Web browsers can then use the information from the DNS to verify that the resources they retrieve from the web server have not been tampered with. The required data structures can be generated automatically, and the framework introduces an initial delay of about 4 ms and a recurring delay for each request of about 2 ms for a sample website.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,Privacy-Preserving Clustering for Multi-dimensional Data Randomization Under LDP,IFIP SEC - International Information Security and Privacy Conference,B,"Randomization of multi-dimensional data under local differential privacy is a significant and practical application of big data. Because of the dimensionality issues, most existing works suffer from low accuracy when estimating joint probability distributions. In this paper, a set of attributes is divided into smaller clusters where the attributes are associated in terms of their dependencies. A privacy-preserving algorithm is proposed to estimate the dependencies of an attribute without disclosing the private values in the multi-dimensional data. Local differential privacy is guaranteed in the scheme. Using the clusters of attributes, the joint probabilities for multi-dimensional data can be estimated efficiently using two building blocks, called RR-independent and RR-Ind-Joint schemes. The experiments using some open datasets demonstrate that the dependencies of attributes can be estimated accurately and that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art schemes in cases where the dimensionality is high.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,Hierarchical Model-Based Cybersecurity Risk Assessment During System Design,IFIP SEC - International Information Security and Privacy Conference,B,"Cybersecurity risk assessment has become a critical priority in systems development and the operation of complex networked systems. However, current state-of-the-art approaches for detecting vulnerabilities, such as automated security testing or penetration testing, often result in late detections. Thus, there is a growing need for security by design, which involves conducting security-related analyses as early as possible in the system development life cycle. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical model-based security risk assessment approach that enables the early assessment of security risks during the system design process. The approach uses different OMG UML-based models, supplemented by a lightweight extension using profiles and stereotypes. Various security attributes, including vulnerability information and asset values, are then used by algorithms to compute relevant properties including threat space, possible attack paths, and selected network-based security metrics. A real-life industrial example is then used to demonstrate the approach.",

Our paper adds to this literature by investigating the role of organizational privacy concerns and risk perceptions on cryptocurrency acceptance. Employing a representative survey of German e-commerce users with 257 respondents we find that while risk perceptions and concerns about data collection do affect adoption willingness for cryptocurrencies, neither are useful for predicting actual adoption behavior. This is especially notable since the lack of central counterparties that may steal funds or personal data was one of the original motivations for the creation of the first cryptocurrencies. Our results provide insight into the nature of cryptocurrency adoption and highlights a discrepancy between intention and behavior.",

Cybersecurity experts use them to make decisions concerning remediation and recovery plans. There are different attack graph-building approaches. We focus on logical attack graphs. Networks and vulnerabilities constantly change; we propose an attack graph enrichment approach based on semantic augmentation post-processing of the logic predicates. Mapping attack graphs with alerts from a monitored system allows for confirming successful attack actions and updating according to network and vulnerability changes. The predicates get periodically updated based on attack evidence and ontology knowledge, allowing us to verify whether changes lead the attacker to the initial goals or cause further damage to the system not anticipated in the initial graphs.

Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,Detecting Web Bots via Mouse Dynamics and Communication Metadata,IFIP SEC - International Information Security and Privacy Conference,B,"The illegitimate automated usage of Internet services by web robots (bots) is an ongoing problem. While bots increase the cost of operations for service providers and can affect user satisfaction, e.g., in social media and games, the main problem is that some services should only be usable by humans, but their automated usage cannot be prevented easily. Currently, services are protected against bots using visual CAPTCHA systems, the de facto standard. However, they are often annoying for users to solve. Typically, CATPCHAs are combined with heuristics and machine-learning approaches to reduce the number of times a human needs to solve them. These approaches use request data like IP and cookies but also biometric data like mouse movements. Such detection systems are primarily closed source, do not provide any performance evaluation, or have unrealistic assumptions, e.g., that sophisticated bots only move the mouse in straight lines. Therefore we conducted an experiment to evaluate the usefulness of detection techniques based on mouse dynamics, request metadata, and a combination of both. Our findings indicate that biometric data in the form of mouse dynamics performs better than request data for bot detection. Further, training a mouse dynamic classifier benefits from external and not only website-specific mouse dynamics. Our classifier, which differentiates between artificial and human mouse movements, achieves similar results to related work under stricter and more realistic conditions.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,Practical Single-Round Secure Wildcard Pattern Matching,IFIP SEC - International Information Security and Privacy Conference,B,"Secure pattern matching allows a client who holds a substring (pattern) to find all the substring’s locations appearing in the long string (text) stored in a server. Meanwhile, the server should not learn any information about the pattern or the matching results. Wildcard pattern matching (WPM) problem, a specific variant with more realistic significance, defines that the pattern contains wildcards that can match any character in the text. Previous studies introduce various approaches for the WPM problem but requires at least a two-round protocol or computation cost linear to input length. Oriented to applications in the client-server mode, however, existing solutions are not practical and efficient enough. Therefore we focus on the round and computation complexity of the WPM. In this paper, under the semi-honest model, we propose a single-round secure WPM protocol based on oblivious transfer (OT) and secret sharing schemes. The insight of our proposed protocol is the reduction from the WPM to the process of secret sharing and reconstruction in a novel way. We provide a customized OT construction and apply the OT extension technique to the protocol, where the client and the server need merely a constant number of public key operations in a round of communication. In addition, we prove the security of the protocol in the ideal/real simulation paradigm and evaluate the performance. Compared to existing secure WPM protocols, both theoretical and experimental results show that our protocol is more practical.",

Therefore, we improved the algorithm of Ed25519 batch verification in all three layers of elliptic curve arithmetic. We put forward a new point structure called PointPuff to accelerate the point-checking and point add processes, improve the traditional elliptic curve multi-scalar multiplication operation, and design a new finite-field large integer multiplication operation.

Beyond the network functionality that IPFS offers, assessing the quality of nodes, i.e. analysing and categorising node software and data, is essential to mitigate possible risks and exploitation of IPFS. To this end, in this work we took three daily snapshots of IPFS nodes within a month and analysed each node (by IP address) individually, using threat intelligence feeds. The above enabled us to quantify the number of potentially malicious and/or abused nodes. The outcomes lead us to consider using a filter to isolate malicious nodes from the network, an approach we implemented as a prototype and used for assessment of effectiveness.",

In view of a sharp increase in cyberattacks today targeting edge computing, these gateways need to provide digital signing and key negotiation for ensuring reliable data sources, trusted applications and authentic devices and connections. In contrast to common perception, we show that post-quantum cryptography methods do not necessitate extensive modification to adopt in such environments; further, the cryptography algorithm’s hardness is preserved while fulfilling the IoT device’s resource limitations.

Ten hypotheses related to how the actions by manual red teams and Lore are perceived and managed by the security analysts are examined. Evaluations were made by studying the subjective judgements of the analysts and by comparing the objective ground truth to their submitted incident reports.

However, given the diversity of the approaches proposed for intrusion detection via IDS probes, an adequate fundamental solution is required. Indeed, most of existing solutions address a specific context which does not allow to assess the efficiency of the proposed models on a different context. Therefore, we propose in this paper an approach for malicious flow detection based on One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN). Our solution extracts features based on the definition of network flows. Thus, it can be common to any network flow classification model. This feature engineering phase is coupled to CNN’s feature detector in order to provide an efficient classification approach. To evaluate its performance, our solution has been evaluated on two different datasets (a recent dataset extracted from a real IBM industrial context and the NSL-KDD dataset that is widely used in the literature). Moreover, a comparison with existing solutions has been provided to NSL-KDD dataset. Attacks in both datasets have been defined using the globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques MITRE framework. The evaluation results have shown that our proposed solution allows an efficient and accurate classification in both datasets (with an accuracy rate of 94% at least).

SHD traffic at the application layer may be encrypted. Besides, the interval between packets can reach tens of seconds or more due to its slow sending rate. Therefore, SHD is concealed for detection. The methods for detecting high-speed DoS are not suitable for detecting the attack, making detection for SHD a challenging problem. Some existing SHD detection methods are complex and computationally intensive, making it hard to meet the demand for real-time in backbone networks. In addition, most of these methods are based on bidirectional traffic and do not consider the asymmetry of routing on the Internet. In this paper, based on the traffic characteristics of the most common types of SHD, we extract several representative features from unidirectional flows. These features can still work well under sampling and asymmetric routing scenarios. We also use Slow HTTP DoS Sketch to record the features quickly and accurately. In experiments that used public backbone datasets as background traffic, the results show that even with a large number of unidirectional flows and a sampling rate of 1/64, our method can still accurately detect SHD traffic within 2 min.",

Applications instead need to rely on the garbage collector to eventually clear sensitive data from memory.

In this paper, we analyze how the popular browsers Chrome, Chromium, Firefox, Opera, and Edge handle input values in memory. We find that sensitive values almost always remain in memory several minutes longer than necessary. We propose the JavaScript library SECPASSINPUT that simulates a non-native input for passwords. The library does not rely on variables of a primitive type, thereby giving web applications the ability to clear and overwrite values in memory. We evaluate the security benefits of SECPASSINPUT by measuring how long values remain in memory after they are no longer needed, finding that the on-screen keyboard of SECPASSINPUT guarantees immediate removal from memory after triggering SECPASSINPUT ’s clear operation.",

We used hill climbing and random walk algorithms to distinguish PageRank’s damping factors based on source and destination ports captured in IP flows. The one-time learning phase on a static data sample allows near-real-time stream-based classification of key hosts from IP flow data in operational conditions without maintaining a complete network graph.

In particular, although participants perceived the same level of privacy risk towards both types of apps, this risk only had a significant negative effect on intention to use in the case of the privacy-enhancing app. Furthermore, disposition to value privacy increased both perceived risk and intention to use the privacy-enhancing app. We discuss these findings in the context of the diffusion of privacy-enhancing tools for user content.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,Real-Time Platform Identification of VPN Video Streaming Based on Side-Channel Attack,IFIP SEC - International Information Security and Privacy Conference,B,"The video platforms that users watch leak the privacy of their preferences. More and more video streaming is being encrypted to protect users’ privacy. In addition, many users use VPN to enhance their privacy protection further. VPN makes video platform identification challenging because it poses traffic obfuscation and further data encryption. Although the segment-based transmission mechanism and Variable Bit-Rate encoding in HAS make network video traffic show still identifiable patterns, most existing work cannot distinguish different platforms due to the similarity of video streaming. Therefore, we propose a traffic-based side-channel attack method to identify VPN video streaming platforms in real time. The aggregated feature sequence of the unidirectional video streaming is extracted to significantly retain the characteristics of different video platforms. Experiments on 10Gbps backbone background traffic show that the F1-score of the method exceeds 97% and can be processed in real time. In addition, we verify the method’s robustness on datasets with different path features and encryption techniques. A comparison with similar methods shows that our method only requires 1/1260 of the storage and 1/60 of the processing time to identify accurately.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,Toward the Establishment of Evaluating URL Embedding Methods Using Intrinsic Evaluator via Malicious URLs Detection,IFIP SEC - International Information Security and Privacy Conference,B,"In order to compare the performance of the malicious URLs detection method, researches used the F-score or other detection accuracy to evaluate, but there are some difficulties in evaluating the URL embedding method used in malicious URLs detection because the detection accuracy is also effect by machine learning or deep learning models and data sets. An evaluation method of URL embedding method that is not affected by other factors is particularly important. In this paper, we proposed an intrinsic evaluation method for URL embedding method that is not affected by machine learning models or deep learning models and data sets. Besides, We analyse some URL embedding methods according to intrinsic and extrinsic methods and offer a guidance in selecting suitable embedding methods in URL by analysing the results.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,Key Management Based on Ownership of Multiple Authenticators in Public Key Authentication,IFIP SEC - International Information Security and Privacy Conference,B,"Public key authentication (PKA) has been deployed in various services to provide stronger authentication to users. In PKA, a user manages private keys on her devices called authenticators, and registers public keys to services. To protect private keys, authenticators are usually designed not to export private keys outside. Nowadays, a user has multiple authenticators like PCs and smartphones, and struggles to manage multiple public keys in many services every time she starts to use new services and replaces some of her authenticators. To ease the burden, we propose a mechanism where users and services manage public keys based on the owner of authenticators and users can access services with PKA using any of their authenticators. We introduce a key pair called an Ownership Verification Key (OVK) consisting of the private key (OVSK) and the public key (OVPK). All authenticators owned by a user derive the same OVSK from the pre-shared secret. Services verify the ownership of the authenticators using the OVPK to decide whether binding the requested public key to her account. To protect user privacy, authenticators generate an unique OVK for each service. We implement the Proof-of-Concept, show that our proposal achieves some security goals, and discuss how to mitigate threats not completely handled.",
