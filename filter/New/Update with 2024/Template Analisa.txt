Title: Usable Authentication in Virtual Reality: Exploring the Usability of PINs and Gestures

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) is becoming increasingly popular with its ability to offer new forms of interaction, user interface, and immersion not only for recreation but also for work, therapy, arts, or education. These new spaces need to be safeguarded by authentication similar to conventional IT systems. However, port ing conventional interfaces to VR has often been found to be less than optimal as it fails to fully embrace the technology’s poten tial and potentially disrupt the immersive experience. This paper evaluates and compares the usability of two major authentication methods for VR: 2D Personal Identification Number (PIN) and gesture-based authentication- with 40 participants. While prior re search has shown promising results in authentication security, there is a lack of studies specifically on usability in VR. Our findings indi cate that the type of authentication and the user’s experience level affect usability, with gesture-based authentication having a higher usability score than a PIN and having faster authentication times. Hereby, users with less VR experience profited the most from a nat ural interaction mode for VR. The results suggest that developers should rather choose a native interaction mode in VR than try to port a familiar conventional interaction such as number pads for PINs.

Threat Model: -

Evaluation-related Section: Methodology The PINs had a four-digit length, and handwriting gestures comprised four sym bols. Both were generated at random to ensure uniqueness among participants. We employed the login time calculation proposed by George et al. [15], which begins at the start of the virtual interface interaction and ends upon password entry via pointing and pressing the enter button. Wrist movements and rela tive wrist coordinates were used to identify gestures, with any four letters from the English alphabet (capitalized or lowercase) accepted for recognition. Stroke order and direction were disregarded to eliminate the need for users to remem ber during training/sample collection. This approach was inspired by the Point Cloud Recognizer [45] and adapted to accommodate 3D gesture recognition, uti lizing the controller gyroscope and inbuilt HMD’s camera to track hand and wrist positions and coordinates during movement. Recruitment. We conducted the study with 40 university graduate students from various de partments. Our recruitment strategy was informed by VR market analysis, which suggested that individuals between 16 and 34 are more likely to use VR [24]. Therefore, we focused on selecting participants falling within this demographic. Our selection process took into account prior experience with VR. Experienced users had used VR systems at least five times before, whereas first-time users had never interacted with VR before. There were no in-betweens. All partici pants possessed normal vision and were right-handed. They did not receive any f inancial compensation. We divided our participants into two authentication groups. Figure 2 shows the participants’ distribution for the data collection process. Prior to commencing the study, we presented our research protocol and in formed participants about our data collection methods. We proceeded to request their consent, giving them the opportunity to decline if they were not comfort able with the process. Following this, we provided a brief training session and introduced them to the VR setup and the input modality. We provided a tuto rial to build familiarity with the authentication method (either PIN or gesture). Participants were then asked to enter their respective authentication type (PIN or gesture). During the trial run, most participants entered their authentication type once. Participants were assigned a four-digit PIN or a four-letter gesture for the main experiment. Gestures incurred the additional step of registering them first (training the system). Subsequently, participants would authenticate themselves with those credentials once. The login time was measured from the beginning of the interaction until the authentication succeeds, i.e., if the user needed to re-enter because of a failed authentication, the total time across all the attempts was considered. Visual feedback in text form informs about the success or failure of the authentication. In a post-study questionnaire, we collected users’ usability evaluation of our authentication systems through a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire [9]. SUS is a quantitative method to evaluate the usability of a system and provides a higher-level overview of the product from the user’s perspective. SUS is also frequently used as a usability comparison tool between two systems [36]. Pilot Testing Twoparticipants who wore glasses encountered difficulties with our HMD. Specif ically, one expressed that they could only see a blur while experimenting. As such, we limited recruiting to participants without corrective glasses. Addition ally, our pilot study revealed that four participants favored a lighter-colored pointer. Thus, we changed the pointer color to a light blue when pointing to a button and a dim white when pointing somewhere else. 4.5 Data Analysis Section 5.1 delves into the impact of authentication type on usability. We an alyzed SUS scores for both PIN and gesture for all 40 participants without considering experience. To compare the difference between independent sample SUS scores for the two authentication types, we conducted the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test [47]. Subsequently, in Section 5.2, we analyzed the impact of authentication type on login time. We conducted a statistical analysis to assess the performance of both methods. Since our data did not follow a normal distribution, we used the Independent-Samples Mann-Whitney U test [29], which is a non-parametric statistical analysis. We furthered our analysis by factoring in experience to examine the impact of authentication types on both usability and login times. We repeated the tests mentioned above within each group for first-time and experienced participants for both PIN and gesture authentication types. 4.6 Ethical Considerations No real credentials were used in the study. Our study was designed to minimize the need for personally identifiable information. We took steps to anonymize all data before processing it. Every participant was required to fill out a consent form and was free to ask questions and withdraw from the study at any time, both during and after participation. We made it clear that their decision to participate was entirely voluntary and that their privacy was paramount to us.

Conclusion: This paper assesses the usability of two distinct authentication methods in vir tual reality- one utilizing a familiar number pad for PINs and the other a handwriting gesture. Based on factors such as login time and SUS score, it then pinpoints the factors that influence the usability of those VR authentica tion methods. The data shows that the type of authentication interaction and the user’s proficiency in virtual reality significantly impact the authentication process’s usability. In particular, the naturalness of interaction, such as with gesture-based authentication, is crucial for usability. The research has shown promising directions regarding the usability of au thentication in virtual reality. Moving forward, we aim to broaden our investiga tion to include more authentication methods and interaction styles. Furthermore, we intend to conduct our study in both laboratory and natural settings. Addi tionally, future work should examine how factors such as design, behavior, and context influence authentication usability.
