IEEE,conferencePaper,2024,Understanding Parentsâ€™ Perceptions and Practices Toward Childrenâ€™s Security and Privacy in Virtual Reality,SP - IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy,A*,"Recent years have seen a sharp increase in the number of underage users in virtual reality (VR), where security and privacy (S&P) risks such as data surveillance and self-disclosure in social interaction have been increasingly prominent. Prior work shows children largely rely on parents to mitigate S&P risks in their technology use. Therefore, understanding parentsâ€™ S&P knowledge, perceptions, and practices is critical for identifying the gaps for parents, technology designers, and policymakers to enhance childrenâ€™s S&P. While such empirical knowledge is substantial in other consumer technologies, it remains largely unknown in the context of VR. To address the gap, we conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 20 parents of children under the age of 18 who use VR at home. Our findings highlight parents generally lack S&P awareness due to the perception that VR is still in its infancy. To protect their childrenâ€™s interactions with VR, parents currently primarily rely on active strategies such as verbal education about S&P. Passive strategies such as using parental controls in VR are not commonly used among our interviewees, mainly due to their perceived technical constraints. Parents also highlight that a multi-stakeholder ecosystem must be established towards more S&P support for children in VR. Based on the findings, we propose actionable S&P recommendations for critical stakeholders, including parents, educators, VR companies, and governments.",Virtual Reality;Security and Privacy;Qualitative studies;Human-centered computing;Technology Use of Parents and Children,Title_Abstract_Keywords,Title_Abstract_Keywords,
Scopus,conferencePaper,2024,Eavesdropping on Controller Acoustic Emanation for Keystroke Inference Attack in Virtual Reality,NDSS - Usenix Network and Distributed System Security Symposium,A*,"Understanding the vulnerability of virtual reality (VR) is crucial for protecting sensitive data and building user trust in VR ecosystems. Previous attacks have demonstrated the feasibility of inferring VR keystrokes inside head-mounted displays (HMDs) by recording side-channel signals generated during user-HMD interactions. However, these attacks are heavily constrained by the physical layout or victim pose in the attack scenario since the recording device must be strictly positioned and oriented in a particular way with respect to the victim. In this paper, we unveil a placement-flexible keystroke inference attack in VR by eavesdropping the clicking sounds of the moving hand controller during keystrokes. The malicious recording smartphone can be placed anywhere surrounding the victim, making the attack more flexible and practical to deploy in VR environments. As the first acoustic attack in VR, our system, Heimdall, overcomes unique challenges unaddressed by previous acoustic attacks on physical keyboards and touchscreens. These challenges include differentiating sounds in a 3D space, adaptive mapping between keystroke sound and key in varying recording placement, and handling occasional hand rotations. Experiments with 30 participants show that Heimdall achieves key inference accuracy of 96.51% and top-5 accuracy of 85.14%–91.22% for inferring passwords with 4–8 characters. Heimdall is also robust under various practical impacts such as smartphone-user placement, attack environments, hardware models, and victim conditions.",,Title_Abstract,Title_Abstract,
Scopus,conferencePaper,2024,That Doesn’t Go There: Attacks on Shared State in Multi-User Augmented Reality Applications,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Augmented Reality (AR) can enable shared virtual experiences between multiple users. In order to do so, it is crucial for multi-user AR applications to establish a consensus on the “shared state” of the virtual world and its augmentations through which users interact. Current methods to create and access shared state collect sensor data from devices (e.g., camera images), process them, and integrate them into the shared state. However, this process introduces new vulnerabilities and opportunities for attacks. Maliciously writing false data to “poison” the shared state is a major concern for the security of the downstream victims that depend on it. Another type of vulnerability arises when reading the shared state: by providing false inputs, an attacker can view hologram augmentations at locations they are not allowed to access. In this work, we demonstrate a series of novel attacks on multiple AR frameworks with shared states, focusing on three publicly accessible frameworks. We show that these frameworks, while using different underlying implementations, scopes, and mechanisms to read from and write to the shared state, have shared vulnerability to a unified threat model. Our evaluations of these state-of-the-art AR frameworks demonstrate reliable attacks both on updating and accessing the shared state across different systems. To defend against such threats, we discuss a number of potential mitigation strategies that can help enhance the security of multi-user AR applications and implement an initial prototype.",,Title_Abstract,Title_Abstract,
Scopus,conferencePaper,2024,Penetration Vision through Virtual Reality Headsets: Identifying 360-degree Videos from Head Movements,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"In this paper, we present the first contactless side-channel attack for identifying 360◦ videos being viewed in a Virtual Reality (VR) Head Mounted Display (HMD). Although the video content is displayed inside the HMD without any external exposure, we observe that user head movements are driven by the video content, which creates a unique side channel that does not exist in traditional 2D videos. By recording the user whose vision is blocked by the HMD via a malicious camera, an attacker can analyze the correlation between the user’s head movements and the victim video to infer the video title. To exploit this new vulnerability, we present INTRUDE, a system for identifying 360◦ videos from recordings of user head movements. INTRUDE is empowered by an HMD-based head movement estimation scheme to extract a head movement trace from the recording and a video saliency-based trace-fingerprint matching framework to infer the video title. Evaluation results show that INTRUDE achieves over 96% of accuracy for video identification and is robust under different recording environments. Moreover, INTRUDE maintains its effectiveness in the open-world identification scenario.",,Title_Abstract,Abstract,
Scopus,conferencePaper,2024,Can Virtual Reality Protect Users from Keystroke Inference Attacks?,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Virtual Reality (VR) has gained popularity by providing immersive and interactive experiences without geographical limitations. It also provides a sense of personal privacy through physical separation. In this paper, we show that despite assumptions of enhanced privacy, VR is unable to shield its users from side-channel attacks that steal private information. Ironically, this vulnerability arises from VR’s greatest strength, its immersive and interactive nature. We demonstrate this by designing and implementing a new set of keystroke inference attacks in shared virtual environments, where an attacker (VR user) can recover the content typed by another VR user by observing their avatar. While the avatar displays noisy telemetry of the user’s hand motion, an intelligent attacker can use that data to recognize typed keys and reconstruct typed content, without knowing the keyboard layout or gathering labeled data. We evaluate the proposed attacks using IRB-approved user studies across multiple VR scenarios. For 13 out of 15 tested users, our attacks accurately recognize 86%-98% of typed keys, and the recovered content retains up to 98% of the meaning of the original typed content. We also discuss potential defenses.",,Title_Abstract,Title_Abstract,

This paper explores UI security for AR platforms, for which we identify three UI security-related properties: Same Space (how does the platform handle virtual content placed at the same coordinates?), Invisibility (how does the platform handle invisible virtual content?), and Synthetic Input (how does the platform handle simulated user input?). We demonstrate the security implications of different instantiations of these properties through five proof-of-concept attacks between distrusting AR application components (i.e., a main app and an included library) — including a clickjacking attack and an object erasure attack. We then empirically investigate these UI security properties on five current AR platforms: ARCore (Google), ARKit (Apple), Hololens (Microsoft), Oculus (Meta), and WebXR (browser). We find that all platforms enable at least three of our proofof-concept attacks to succeed. We discuss potential future defenses, including applying lessons from 2D UI security and identifying new directions for AR UI security.",,Title_Abstract,Title_Abstract,

AR head-mounted displays (HMDs) have shown promise in supporting them due to its capability of recognizing and augmenting the challenging environments in a hands-free manner. However, the design space have not been thoroughly explored by involving various FRs who serve different roles (e.g., firefighters, law enforcement) but collaborate closely in the field. We interviewed 26 first responders in the field who experienced a state-of-the-art optical-see-through AR HMD, as well as its interaction techniques and four types of AR cues (i.e., overview cues, directional cues, highlighting cues, and labeling cues), soliciting their first-hand experiences, design ideas, and concerns. Our study revealed both generic and role-specific preferences and needs for AR hardware, interactions, and feedback, as well as identifying desired AR designs tailored to urgent, risky scenarios (e.g., affordance augmentation to facilitate fast and safe action). While acknowledging the value of AR HMDs, concerns were also raised around trust, privacy, and proper integration with other equipment. Finally, we derived comprehensive and actionable design guidelines to inform future AR systems for in-field FRs.",Augmented Reality; Design; First Responders; In-the-field Tasks,Keywords,Abstract,

In this paper, we introduce EITPose, a wrist-worn, continuous 3D hand pose estimation approach that uses eight electrodes positioned around the forearm to model its interior impedance distribution during pose articulation. Unlike wrist-worn systems relying on cameras, EITPose has a slim profile (12 mm thick sensing strap) and is power-efficient (consuming only 0.3 W of power), making it an excellent candidate for integration into consumer electronic devices. In a user study involving 22 participants, EITPose achieves with a within-session mean per joint positional error of 11.06 mm. Its camera-free design prioritizes user privacy, yet it maintains cross-session and cross-user accuracy levels comparable to camera-based wrist-worn systems, thus making EITPose a promising technology for practical hand pose estimation.",Extended Reality; Input; Electrical Impedance Tomography; Natural User Interfaces; Hand Gesture; Hand Pose; Interaction Technique,Keywords,Abstract,

ACM DL,conferencePaper,2024,What You Experience is What We Collect: User Experience Based Fine-Grained Permissions for Everyday Augmented Reality,CHI - Human Factors in Computing Systems,A*,"Everyday Augmented Reality (AR) headsets pose significant privacy risks, potentially allowing prolonged sensitive data collection of both users and bystanders (e.g. members of the public). While users control data access through permissions, current AR systems inherit smartphone permission prompts, which may be less appropriate for all-day AR. This constrains informed choices and risks over-privileged access to sensors. We propose (N=20) a novel AR permission control system that allows better-informed privacy decisions and evaluate it using five mock application contexts. Our system’s novelty lies in enabling users to experience the varying impacts of permission levels on not only a) privacy, but also b) application functionality. This empowers users to better understand what data an application depends on and how its functionalities are impacted by limiting said data. Participants found that our method allows for making better informed privacy decisions, and deemed it more transparent and trustworthy than state-of-the-art AR and smartphone permission systems taken from Android and iOS.

This spatiotemporal data forms a Kinetic Signature, which is a user-dependent behavioral biometric trait. Although kinetic signatures have been widely used in recent research, the factors contributing to their degree of identifiability remain mostly unexplored. Drawing from existing literature, this work systematically examines the influence of static and dynamic components in human motion. We conducted a user study (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;24) with two sessions to reidentify users across different VR sports and exercises after one week. We found that the identifiability of a kinetic signature depends on its inherent static and dynamic factors, with the best combination allowing for 90.91% identification accuracy after one week had passed.

Our findings demonstrate that many factors, such as data types and sensitivity, affect users’ perceptions of privacy in XR. However, users’ limited awareness of XR sensors’ granular data collection capabilities, such as involuntary body signals of emotional responses, restricted the range of privacy-protective strategies they used.

ACM DL,conferencePaper,2024,An Empirical Study on Oculus Virtual Reality Applications: Security and Privacy Perspectives,ICSE - International Conference on Software Engineering,A*,"Although Virtual Reality (VR) has accelerated its prevalent adoption in emerging metaverse applications, it is not a fundamentally new technology. On one hand, most VR operating systems (OS) are based on off-the-shelf mobile OS (e.g., Android). As a result, VR apps also inherit privacy and security deficiencies from conventional mobile apps. On the other hand, in contrast to conventional mobile apps, VR apps can achieve immersive experience via diverse VR devices, such as head-mounted displays, body sensors, and controllers though achieving this requires the extensive collection of privacy-sensitive human biometrics (e.g., hand-tracking and face-tracking data). Moreover, VR apps have been typically implemented by 3D gaming engines (e.g., Unity), which also contain intrinsic security vulnerabilities. Inappropriate use of these technologies may incur privacy leaks and security vulnerabilities although these issues have not received significant attention compared to the proliferation of diverse VR apps. In this paper, we develop a security and privacy assessment tool, namely the VR-SP detector for VR apps. The VR-SP detector has integrated program static analysis tools and privacy-policy analysis methods. Using the VR-SP detector, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on 500 popular VR apps. We obtain the original apps from the popular Oculus and SideQuest app stores and extract APK files via the Meta Oculus Quest 2 device. We evaluate security vulnerabilities and privacy data leaks of these VR apps by VR app analysis, taint analysis, and privacy-policy analysis. We find that a number of security vulnerabilities and privacy leaks widely exist in VR apps. Moreover, our results also reveal conflicting representations in the privacy policies of these apps and inconsistencies of the actual data collection with the privacy-policy statements of the apps. Based on these findings, we make suggestions for the future development of VR apps.",metaverse; security and privacy; static analysis; virtual reality,Title_Abstract_Keywords,Title_Abstract_Keywords,

This method allows combining three layers of verification: knowledge-based password input, handwriting style analysis, and motion profile recognition. As a first step towards realizing this potential, we focus on verifying users based on their motion profiles. We conducted a data collection study with 48 participants, who performed over 3800 Motion Password signatures across two sessions. We assessed the effectiveness of feature-distance and similarity-learning methods for motion-based verification using the Motion Passwords as well as specific and uniform ball-throwing signatures used in previous works. In our results, the similarity-learning model was able to verify users with the same accuracy for both signature types. This demonstrates that Motion Passwords, even when applying only the motion-based verification layer, achieve reliability comparable to previous methods. This highlights the potential for Motion Passwords to become even more reliable with the addition of knowledge-based and handwriting style verification layers. Furthermore, we present a proof-of-concept Unity application demonstrating the registration and verification process with our pretrained similarity-learning model.

However, existing WBR research mainly focuses on improving the recognition precision, while rarely studying the security aspects. In this article, we reveal that WBR systems are vulnerable to manipulating physical signals. For instance, our observation shows that WiFi signals can be changed by jamming signals. By exploiting the vulnerability, we propose two approaches to generate physically online adversarial samples to perform untargeted attack and targeted attack, respectively. The effectiveness of these attacks are extensively evaluated over four real-world WBR systems.

However, due to the limited battery capacity of VR devices, it is common for users to rely on charging cables, which serve the dual purpose of power supply and audio output, to recharge their VR devices while in use. In this study, we propose an inconspicuous and stealthy side channel attack, coined as LineTalker, which can unveil visual-related and audio-related activities from VR devices during the charging process. The insight behind LineTalker is rooted in the observation that visual-related activities (e.g., 3D image rendering) are power-intensive and result in fluctuations in the current strength of the cable's power supply line, which can be leveraged as side channel information. Similarly, audio-related activities (e.g., playing music) leave traces on the cable's audio output line. Rather than providing a user with a compromised charging cable (i.e., embedding a current sensor) to measure the current strength, to make the attack less conspicuous, LineTalker employs the Hall effect to indirectly access side channel information. This is achieved by capturing magnetic signals using a Hall sensor placed near the target cable in a contactless manner. Experimental results demonstrate that LineTalker achieves an overall accuracy of 94.60% and 64.38% in inferring user activities in VR devices with intrusive and non-intrusive attack manners, respectively.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",charging cable; non-intrusive attack; privacy inference; side channel attack; Virtual reality,Abstract_Keywords,Title_Abstract_Keywords,
Scopus,journalPaper,2024,An Anti-Disguise Authentication System Using the First Impression of Avatar in Metaverse,TOIFS - Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,A,"Metaverse is a vast virtual world parallel to the physical world, where the user acts as an avatar to enjoy various services that break through the temporal and spatial limitations of the physical world. Metaverse allows users to create arbitrary digital appearances as their own avatars by which an adversary may disguise his/her avatar to fraud others. In this paper, we propose an anti-disguise authentication method that draws on the idea of the first impression from the physical world to recognize an old friend. Specifically, the first meeting scenario in the metaverse is stored and recalled to help the authentication between avatars. To prevent the adversary from replacing and forging the first impression, we construct a chameleon-based signcryption mechanism and design a ciphertext authentication protocol to ensure the public verifiability of encrypted identities. The security analysis shows that the proposed signcryption mechanism meets not only the security requirement but also the public verifiability. Besides, the ciphertext authentication protocol has the capability of defending against the replacing and forging attacks on the first impression. Extensive experiments show that the proposed avatar authentication system is able to achieve anti-disguise authentication at a low storage consumption on the blockchain.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",anti-disguise; authentication; avatar; Metaverse,Title_Abstract_Keywords,Title_Abstract_Keywords,
Scopus,journalPaper,2024,Privacy-Preserving Gaze Data Streaming in Immersive Interactive Virtual Reality: Robustness and User Experience,TVCG - Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,A,"Eye tracking is routinely being incorporated into virtual reality (VR) systems. Prior research has shown that eye tracking data, if exposed, can be used for re-identification attacks [14]. The state of our knowledge about currently existing privacy mechanisms is limited to privacy-utility trade-off curves based on data-centric metrics of utility, such as prediction error, and black-box threat models. We propose that for interactive VR applications, it is essential to consider user-centric notions of utility and a variety of threat models. We develop a methodology to evaluate real-time privacy mechanisms for interactive VR applications that incorporate subjective user experience and task performance metrics. We evaluate selected privacy mechanisms using this methodology and find that re-identification accuracy can be decreased to as low as 14% while maintaining a high usability score and reasonable task performance. Finally, we elucidate three threat scenarios (black-box, black-box with exemplars, and white-box) and assess how well the different privacy mechanisms hold up to these adversarial scenarios. This work advances the state of the art in VR privacy by providing a methodology for end-to-end assessment of the risk of re-identification attacks and potential mitigating solutions. f  © 1995-2012 IEEE.",eye tracking; privacy; Virtual reality,Title_Abstract_Keywords,Title_Abstract_Keywords,

Scopus,journalPaper,2024,Analysis and Design of Efficient Authentication Techniques for Password Entry with the Qwerty Keyboard for VR Environments,TVCG - Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,A,"Authentication in digital security relies heavily on text-based passwords, even with other available methods like biometrics and graphical passwords. While virtual reality (VR) keyboards are typically invisible to onlookers, the presence of inconspicuous sensors, including accelerometers, gyroscopes, and barometers, poses a potential risk of unauthorized observation and recording. Traditional defense shoulder-surfing attack methods typically involve breaking apart the Qwerty layout, which destroys the user's inherent familiarity with the layout. This research addresses the need for secure password entry in VR environments while retaining the Qwerty layout. We explore three keyboard-related position alteration strategies to ensure security while mitigating the decline in user experience. These strategies involve moving the entire keyboard, cursor, and keys. Our theoretical study assesses the effectiveness of these strategies against shoulder-surfing attacks. Two user studies, employing ray-based and position-based text entry methods, respectively, evaluate the practical effectiveness of the three strategies in resisting shoulder-surfing attacks, as well as their impact on typing performance and user experience. Our findings demonstrate that the three strategies achieve shoulder-surfing attack resistance comparable to a random layout keyboard. Moreover, compared to a random layout, the two strategies involving the movement of the entire keyboard and the repositioning of keys support faster entry rates and enhanced user experience. © 1995-2012 IEEE.",keyboard layout; password; text entry; user study; Virtual reality,Abstract_Keywords,Title_Abstract,
Scopus,conferencePaper,2024,Usable Authentication in Virtual Reality: Exploring the Usability of PINs and Gestures,ACNS - International Conference on Applied Cryptography and Network Security,B,"Virtual Reality (VR) is becoming increasingly popular with its ability to offer new forms of interaction, user interface, and immersion not only for recreation but also for work, therapy, arts, or education. These new spaces need to be safeguarded by authentication similar to conventional IT systems. However, porting conventional interfaces to VR has often been found to be less than optimal as it fails to fully embrace the technology’s potential and potentially disrupt the immersive experience. This paper evaluates and compares the usability of two major authentication methods for VR: 2D Personal Identification Number (PIN) and gesture-based authentication - with 40 participants. While prior research has shown promising results in authentication security, there is a lack of studies specifically on usability in VR. Our findings indicate that the type of authentication and the user’s experience level affect usability, with gesture-based authentication having a higher usability score than a PIN and having faster authentication times. Hereby, users with less VR experience profited the most from a natural interaction mode for VR. The results suggest that developers should rather choose a native interaction mode in VR than try to port a familiar conventional interaction such as number pads for PINs. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Authentication; Gestures; PINs; Usability; Virtual Reality,Title_Abstract_Keywords,Title_Abstract_Keywords,
Scopus,conferencePaper,2024,Leveraging Overshadowing for Time-Delay Attacks in 4G/5G Cellular Networks: An Empirical Assessment,"ARES - International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security",B,"Ensuring both reliable and low-latency communications over 4G or 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) is a key feature for services such as smart power grids and the metaverse. However, the lack of appropriate security mechanisms at the lower-layer protocols of the RAN–a heritage from 4G networks–opens up vulnerabilities that can be exploited to conduct stealthy Reduction-of-Quality attacks against the latency guarantees. This paper presents an empirical assessment of a proposed time-delay attack that leverages overshadowing to exploit the reliability mechanisms of the Radio Link Control (RLC) in Acknowledged Mode. By injecting falsified RLC Negative Acknowledgements, an attacker can maliciously trigger retransmissions at the victim User Equipment (UE), degrading the uplink latency of application flows. Extensive experimental evaluations on open-source and commercial off-the-shelf UEs demonstrate the attack’s effectiveness in increasing latency, network load, and buffer occupancy. The attack impact is quantified by varying the bitrate representing different applications and the number of injected negative acknowledgments controlling the attack intensity. This work studies a realistic threat against the latency quality of service in 4G/5G RANs and highlights the urgent need to revisit protocol security at the lower-RAN layers for 5G (and beyond) networks.",Deny of Service; Latency; Man on the Side; Overshadowing; Radio Access Network; Reduction of Quality; Time-delay,Abstract,Title_Abstract,
Scopus,conferencePaper,2024,A Domain-Specific Language for Augmented Reality Games,SAC - Selected Areas in Cryptography,B,"Augmented Reality (AR) applications have become popular over the last few years, with significant impact on video games. AR does not require advanced technology, but a mobile device with a camera is enough. However, building AR games is time-consuming and requires deep expertise in the tools, technologies and programming languages of the field, as well as on mathematical concepts related to the graphics and physics of the virtual objects. We attack this problem by means of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) named argDSL, tailored to create AR games. It offers primitives to customise the domain and logic of the game, the physics of the virtual objects, and their graphical representation. We provide an Eclipse environment enabling the definition of AR games using the DSL, and an iOS client able to run the defined games.",augmented reality; domain-specific languages; games,Title_Abstract_Keywords,Abstract,

The advent of millimeter wave (mmWave) technology has significantly enhanced the capabilities of wireless HAR systems. This paper presents the first systematic study on the vulnerabilities of mmWave-based HAR to label flipping poisoning attacks in the context of supervised contrastive learning. We identify three label poisoning attacks on the contrastive mmWave-based HAR and propose corresponding countermeasures. The efficacy of the attacks and also our countermeasures are experimentally validated on a prototype system. The attacks and countermeasures can be easily extended to other wireless HAR systems, thereby promoting security considerations in system design and deployment.",human activity recognition; label poisoning; millimeter-wave (mmwave) technology; supervised contrastive learning (scl),Abstract,Abstract,
Scopus,conferencePaper,2024,De-anonymizing VR Avatars using Non-VR Motion Side-channels,WiSec - Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks,B,"Virtual Reality (VR) technology offers an immersive audio-visual experience to users through which they can interact with a digitally represented 3D space (i.e., a virtual world) using a headset device. By (visually) transporting users from their physical world to realistic virtual spaces, VR systems enable interactive and true-to-life versions of traditional applications such as gaming, remote conferencing and virtual tourism. However, VR applications also present significant user-privacy challenges. This paper studies a new type of privacy threat targeting VR users which attempts to connect their activities visible in the virtual world to their physical state sensed in the real world. Specifically, this paper analyzes the feasibility of carrying out a de-anonymization or identification attack on VR users by correlating visually observed movements of users' avatars in the virtual world with some auxiliary data (e.g., motion sensor data from mobile/wearable devices) representing their context/state in the physical world. To enable this attack, the paper proposes a novel framework which first employs a learning-based activity classification approach to translate the disparate visual movement data and motion sensor data into an activity-vector to ease comparison, followed by a filtering and identity ranking phase outputting an ordered list of potential identities corresponding to the target visual movement data. A comprehensive empirical evaluation of the proposed framework is conducted to study the feasibility of such a de-anonymization attack.",de-anonymization; motion; side channel; virtual reality,Abstract_Keywords,Abstract,
