IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,"Keynote: In Varietate Concordia: How Software Visualization and Information Visualization Have Evolved From, Around, and Along Each Other",VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Software visualization (softvis) and information visualization (infovis) have a long, interconnected, and complex joint history. Originally appearing as a subdomain of infovis which focuses on solving problems coming from the software engineering domain, softvis has grown in the last two decades to become a selfstanding field with distinct challenges, key results, events, and community. In the same time, the independent growth of the two fields has made the transfer of ideas, techniques, methods, application cases, and researchers between the two domains increasingly challenges. In this talk, I will present a history of this highly dynamic process and argue about the need for raprochemment of infovis and softvis. This need is supported by two key aspects identified and further discussed: (1) Complementarity of the two fields advocates for more interaction, as shown by success stories from softvis which led to entirely novel branches of development into the infovis field and, conversely, recent key developments in infovis which offer strong potential to be picked up to address existing key challenges in softvis. (2) Commonality, in terms of both fields essentially aiming to solve very similar visualization problems that address very similar data and using related visualization pipelines, advocates on an increasingly joint approach in their further development.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,A Visualization for Client-Server Architecture Assessement,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Maintaining large legacy systems often requires understanding their architecture. This is important since legacy system architecture decay over time and architecture violations may dramatically impact planned renovation actions. Merely reading source files is time-consuming and often highly inefficient. Visualizations have been proposed as a tool to support archi-tecture understanding. Some software architecture visualizations decompose the software system architecture into layers, components, or slices from a structural viewpoint. Such visualizations, however, do not take into account the specificities of client-server applications. They do not help maintainers identify and understand software architecture violations. In this paper, we propose Cliservo, a new visualization to help software main-tainers detect architectural violations in client-server systems. Cliservo classifies client-server entities into different levels of dependencies, shared entities, or ambiguous entities (e.g., entities that belong abnormally to different layers). Cliservo identifies and presents entities in their corresponding layers from two distinct viewpoints: global overview entities and violations, i.e ambiguous entities and illegal dependencies between layers. We validated our approach on three real-world industrial projects with access to their maintainers. We report the findings of 91 ambiguous entities, 29 purportedly shared and idle entities, 24 and 82 elements defined as shared but only used by the client or server, and 12 relations violating the layered architecture.",Client-server;visualization;architectural violation
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Visualizing Kubernetes Distributed Systems: An Exploratory Study,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Distributed applications running on virtualization- based systems and cloud computing have become popular solutions, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than dealing with the complexities of distributed systems. However, these applications often become increasingly complex, presenting multiple management challenges. To address this issue, software visualization approaches offer valuable solutions by pro-viding real-time insights into resources and their functionalities, offering a comprehensive overview. This study aims to analyze and evaluate existing software visualization tools for distributed applications on the Kubernetes platform. The objective is to comprehensively examine these tools' features, capabilities, and limitations to understand their effectiveness in visualizing complex distributed systems. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the available visualization tools, enabling researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions and advancements in software visualization for distributed applications on the Kubernetesplatform. Our research identified eight Kubernetes visualization tools, which were examined and compared based on relevant char-acteristics related to distributed applications and software vi-sualization standards. However, it is worth noting that despite the excellent work done by the community in establishing these first proposals, these tools currently only support, on average, a visualization of 9 % of the total resource types available, as mentioned in the official documentation. Therefore, we propose guidelines followed by a synthesized visualization that can guide further research and development in this area. Our study will assist users in selecting the most suitable Kubernetes visualization tool and encourage researchers and the community to explore new approaches in Kubernetes visualization.",software visualization;exploratory study;distributed systems;kubernetes
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Visually Analyzing Company-Wide Software Service Dependencies: An Industrial Case Study,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Managing dependencies between software services is a crucial task for any company operating cloud applications. Visualizations can help to understand and maintain these com-plex dependencies. In this paper, we present a force-directed service dependency visualization and filtering tool that has been developed and used within SAP. The tool's use cases include guiding service retirement as well as understanding service deployment landscapes and their relationship to the company's organizational structure. We report how we built and adapted the tool under strict time constraints to address the requirements of our users. We further share insights on how we enabled internal adoption. For us, starting with a minimal viable visualization and then quickly responding to user feedback was essential for convincing users of the tool's value. The final version of the tool enabled users to visually understand company-wide service consumption, supporting data-driven decision making.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Interactively Exploring API Changes and Versioning Consistency,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) evolve over time. As they change, they are expected to be versioned based on how changes might affect their clients. In this paper, we present two novel visualizations specifically designed to represent all structural changes and the level of adherence to semantic versioning practices over time. They can also serve for characterizing and comparing the evolution history of different Web APIs. The API Version Clockhelps to visualize the sequence of API changes over time and highlight inconsistencies between major, minor, or patch version changes and the corresponding introduced breaking or non-breaking changes applied to the API. The API Changesoverview aggregates all changes to an OpenAPI (OAS) description, highlighting the unstable vs. the stable elements of the API over its entire history. Both visualizations can be automatically created using the APIcTURE, a command-line and web-based tool that analyzes the histories of git code repositories containing OAS descriptions, extracting the necessary data for generating visualizations and computing metrics related to API evolution and versioning. The visualizations have been successfully applied to classify, compare, and interactively explore the multi-year evolution history of APIs with up to hundreds of individual commits.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Visualizing Source Code as Comics Using Generative AI,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"The architecture and inner structure of software is often only implicitly available in the form of its source code and thus not tangible and intuitively easy to understand for non-programmers and laymen. Our goal is to create visualizations as automatically as possible, with which such people can neverthe-less understand the software or parts of the software and get a feel for the structure of the software and how its methods work. Especially for newcomers to software projects, for management or even for students and pupils, it can be helpful to get a non-technical insight into the software. We use the concept of visualizing information as comics to present aspects of the software as strikingly as possible, as comics are an effective way to present complex systems and interrelationships for certain target groups. For this purpose, we present a method to generate comics from source code. Our semi-automated process is based on generating a prompt for an LLM from source code, which in turn generates a prompt for a comic image generation using the text-to-image model Stable Diffusion. We show that generative AI methods can be used to rapidly generate human-compatible artistic representations from source code. However, further research is needed to validate the understandability of the results.",visualization;software visualization;comics;generative ai;stable diffusion
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,$\mu$ PrintGen: Supporting Workflow Logs Analysis Through Visual Microprint,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"A microprint is a visualization that condenses the contents of a text file into a small space. This is done by using colored scaled -down characters or pixels to represent each character of the text. The colors aim to highlight information relevant to the user. We have created Î¼PrintGen, a framework for creating custom microprints by associating colors to rules that specify what is included or excluded from the line, with plain text or regular expressions. At the same time, the user can customize the look and structure of the created microprint for ease of use. We also created $\mu$ PrintVis, a website for viewing the created microprints that supports various navigation features, like zoom and search. Feedback from the Rust and Julia open-source communities shows that Î¼PrintGen lets users navigate through large log files, while easily highlighting reported errors. Two experts agree on the benefits of $\mu$ PrintGen, compared to pure textual-based searching features commonly offered by text editors.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,"Collaborative, Code-Proximal Dynamic Software Visualization within Code Editors",VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Software visualizations are usually realized as standalone and isolated tools that use embedded code viewers within the visualization. In the context of program comprehension, only few approaches integrate visualizations into code editors, such as integrated development environments. This is surprising since professional developers consider reading source code as one of the most important ways to understand software, therefore spend a lot of time with code editors. In this paper, we introduce the design and proof-of-concept implementation for a software visualization approach that can be embedded into code editors. Our contribution differs from related work in that we use dynamic analysis of a software system's runtime behavior. Additionally, we incorporate distributed tracing. This enables developers to understand how, for example, the currently handled source code behaves as a fully deployed, distributed software system. Our visualization approach enhances common remote pair programming tools and is collaboratively usable by employing shared code cities. As a result, user interactions are synchronized between code editor and visualization, as well as broadcasted to collaborators. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that combines code editors with collaboratively usable code cities. Therefore, we conducted a user study to collect first-time feedback regarding the perceived usefulness and perceived usability of our approach. We additionally collected logging information to provide more data regarding time spent in code cities that are embedded in code editors. Seven teams with two students each participated in that study. The results show that the majority of participants find our approach useful and would employ it for their own use. We provide each participant's video recording, raw results, and all steps to reproduce our experiment as supplementary package. Furthermore, a live demo of our tool is available online.11https.//code.explorviz.dev We invite other researchers to extend our open-source software.22https://github.com/ExplorViz Video URL: https://youtu.be/3qZVSehnEug",software visualization;dynamic analysis;program comprehension;pair programming;integrated development environment
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Problems in Microservice Development: Supporting Visualisation,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"In microservice architectures, developers can face significant problems understanding the structure of the system and how the different microservices interact. This difficulty results from the distributed nature of the system, and the abundance of inter-service communication within the architecture. We want to determine if network visualisations can address these problems given their ability to convey complex topologies. However, to identify what architectural characteristics should be visualised, and how this should be done, we must first determine the needs of microservice developers. This paper identifies and presents the impact and frequency of problems faced by a cohort of microservice developers using the results of an online survey. Our findings indicate that the most frequent problems were topology related and the highest impact problems were those related to system faults and data structures. Our results support the use of network visualisations to address microservice development problems and provide context that will allow future visualisations of any type to better address these problems.",Microservices;development problems;documentation;microservice visualisation
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,What's in a Name? Linear Temporal Logic Literally Represents Time Lines,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is arguably the most popular specification language for formal verification of safety-critical systems. However, LTL formulas can be unintuitive and error- prone for human practitioners to specify and validate. Meanwhile, drawing timelines remains one of the most popular methods for specifying and validating requirements for indus-trial system designs, such as in aerospace operational concepts. Therefore, we provide a new timeline tool for visualizing LTL specifications as timelines, providing provably-correct, intuitive equivalents between these two specification formats. Our tool generates timeline visualizations by translating LTL formulas to intermediate representations as Buchi automata and then regular expressions, and finally simplifying and visualizing the expressions. We provide an algorithm for this visualization, a theoretical soundness analysisâ€ and an implementation.",Modal and Temporal Logics;Logic and Verification;Regular languages
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Understanding the NPM Dependencies Ecosystem of a Project Using Virtual Reality,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Modern JavaScript development relies heavily on using Node Package Manager (NPM) modules. These modules are related by dependency relationships, possibly requiring dozens or hundreds of modules to build a complete JavaScript web application. Studying dependencies, in terms of their sustainability, vulnerability, size, defects, etc., is fundamental for the deployment and maintenance of JavaScript web applications. We use a 3D metaphor based on presenting dependencies as an â€œelevated cityâ€, mapping both dependency relationships and characteristics of interest of each module. We developed a VR (virtual reality) scene representing the dependencies of several web applications using the elevated city metaphor, and exposed industrial experts to it to check its suitability. They explored a medium-sized project, with more than 200 dependencies, sharing their insights. The results highlight different aspects of our approach and how the combination of metrics helps experts to obtain insights from the ecosystem. The feedback shows the usefulness of the visualization to check and explore several aspects of the dependencies of an application, helping to identify problems related to maintainability, license usage, or vulnerabilities, and to design strategies to address them.",virtual reality;elevated city;software visualization;ecosystem;npm dependencies
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,DGT-AR: Visualizing Code Dependencies in AR,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Analyzing source code dependencies between components within a program is an essential activity in software development. While various software visualization tools have been proposed to aid in this activity, most are limited to desktop applications. As a result, the potential impact of augmented reality (AR) on improving dependency analysis remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present DGT-AR, a node-link visualization tool for code dependencies in immersive augmented reality. DG T-AR extends the physical screen space of IDEs to the infinite virtual space. That is, developers neither have to sacrifice screen space nor leave the IDE and use third-party applications. We present the preliminary results of a pilot user study along with four key lessons learned. Additionally, we have made DGT-AR publicly available.",software quality;software visualization;augmented reality;software dependencies
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,iTrace-Visualize: Visualizing Eye-Tracking Data for Software Engineering Studies,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"iTrace is community infrastructure that allows software engineering researchers to conduct eye-tracking studies on large realistic code bases. The iTrace infrastructure consists of a set of tools that assist with gathering, processing, and evaluating eye-tracking data on large software projects within an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). A typical eye-tracking study results in millions of raw gazes that are overwhelming to view and sort through. To help researchers view and comprehend this data, iTrace-Visualize is presented. This tool integrates information produced by the iTrace infrastructure into a dynamic video recording of the eye-tracking session. Eye fixations and the scan path between fixations are overlayed on the video. Additionally, the line being examined can be highlighted in the video. iTrace-Visualize lets a researcher replay eye fixations via a video overlay immediately after a study. This serves as quick validation of what was done during the study and can also provide quick insights into what the participants looked at. To illustrate iTrace-Visualize's capabilities, a small preliminary study is performed. Demo Video-https://youtu.be/c1hUFDmBM50",eye tracking;fixations;pipeline

The main interface the classical IDE offers is a text editor for the source code. Code, documentation, and the running system are disconnected.In this keynote presentation, we will show how software systems can be made explainable with the help of three interacting technologies: (i) live notebooks that can be used to create narratives that link documentation, source code, and running applications, (ii) example methods that not only perform tests, but produce live examples that can be used within narratives, to explain use cases, scenarios and features, and (iii) a moldable inspector that can be easily extended with live custom views to answer domain-specific questions about software systems.With the help of running examples we will show in the keynotes presentation how these technologies work together to provide a radically different kind of development experience.",Smalltalk;program comprehension;notebooks;testing;debugging
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,ViSRE: A Unified Visual Analysis Dashboard for Proactive Cloud Outage Management,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Efficient outage detection and remediation is crucial for effectively operating cloud computing systems. To remediate outages, system engineers must quickly identify the causal relationships between metrics and correlate events across multiple monitoring tools. In practice, this process largely remains reactive due to the complexity and general lack of interpretability within such monitoring environments. This work presents ViSRE: an integrated visual analytics system that integrates causal and predictive models with interactive visualizations to aid in proactive cloud outage management. We develop enhanced node representations for our causal graph representation to support system engineers in performing root cause analysis and reasoning about causality chains in multi-dimensional temporal data. We report the results of a quantitative assessment of the proposed predictive models, which show good performance guarantees. To evaluate and refine our system, we conduct a study with six cloud system engineers who verify that our proposed techniques can support proactive cloud maintenance by intuitively displaying temporal relationships between predicted and raw data. By correlating and presenting data from disparate sources, ViSRE also reduces context switching costs and reduces the time spent on manually correlating events during remediation of time-critical outages.",Cloud Outage Prediction;Root Cause Analysis;Software Visualization
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,How Does This New Developer Test Fit In? A Visualization to Understand Amplified Test Cases,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Developer testing, the practice of software engineers programmatically checking that their own components behave as they expect, has become the norm in todayâ€™s software projects. With the constantly growing size and complexity of software projects and with the rise of automated test generation tools, understanding a test case is becoming more and more important compared to writing test cases from scratch.This holds especially in the area of developer-centric test amplification, where a tool automatically generates new test cases to improve a developer-maintained test suite. To investigate how visualization can help developers understand and judge test cases, we present the TESTIMPACTGRAPH, a visualization of the call tree and coverage impact of a JUnit test case proposed for amplification. It empowers the developer to drill down into the behavior of a test case, as well as providing them a clear view on how the proposed test case contributes to the coverage of the overall test suite. In a think-aloud study we investigate which information developers seek from the TESTIMPACTGRAPH, how its features can support them in accessing this information, and observations regarding the coverage impact of test cases. We infer ten actionable recommendations on how developer tests can be visualized to help developers understand their behavior and impact.",Software Testing;Test Amplification;Test Review;Test Visualization;Test Understanding
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,A New Generation of CLASS BLUEPRINT,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"In object-oriented programming, classes are the primary abstraction mechanism used by and exposed to developers. Understanding classes is key for the development and evolution of object-oriented applications. The fundamental problem faced by developers is that while classes are intrinsically structured entities, in IDEs they are represented as a blob of text. The idea behind the original CLASS BLUEPRINT visualization was to represent the internal structure of classes in terms of fields, their accesses, and the method call flow. Additional information was depicted using colors. The thus created visualization proved to be an effective means to support program comprehension. However, a number of omissions rendered it only partially useful.We propose CLASS BLUEPRINT V2 (in short BLUEPRINTV2), which in addition to the information depicted by CLASS BLUEPRINT also supports dead code identification, methods under tests, and calling relationships between class and instance level methods. In addition, BLUEPRINTV2 enhances the understanding of fields by showing how fields of super/subclasses are accessed. We present the enhanced visualization and report on a first validation with 26 developers and 18 projects.",Visualization;program comprehension;code quality
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,"Domain-Centered Support for Layout, Tasks, and Specification for Control Flow Graph Visualization",VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Computing professionals in areas like compilers, performance analysis, and security often analyze and manipulate control flow graphs (CFGs) in their work. CFGs are directed networks that describe possible orderings of instructions in the execution of a program. Visualizing a CFG is a common activity in developing or debugging computational approaches that use them. However, general graph drawing layouts, including the hierarchical ones frequently applied to CFGs, do not capture CFG-specific structures or tasks and thus the resulting drawing may not match the needs of their audience, especially for more complicated programs. While several algorithms offer flexibility in specifying the layout, they often require expertise with graph drawing layouts and primitives that these potential users do not have. To bring domain-specific CFG drawing to this audience, we develop CFGConf, a library designed to match the abstraction level of CFG experts. CFGConf provides a JSON interface that produces drawings that can stand-alone or be integrated into multi-view visualization systems. We developed CFGConf through an interactive design process with experts while incorporating lessons learned from previous CFG visualization systems, a survey of CFG drawing conventions in computing systems conferences, and existing design principles for notations. We evaluate CFGConf in terms of expressiveness, usability, and notational efficiency through a user study and illustrative examples. CFG experts were able to use the library to produce the domain-aware layouts and appreciated the task-aware nature of the specification.",control flow graphs;graph drawing;visualization systems and tools;human-centered computing
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Visualizing Code Smells: Tables or Code Cities? A Controlled Experiment,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"This paper presents a study in which we compared the visualization of code smells in Code Cities with classical tabular representations. We conducted a controlled experiment with 20 participants who had to solve six tasks in both environments. We evaluated the results of our experiment statistically and came to the following conclusions: In four tasks the completion time was significantly lower when using Code Cities (the remaining two tasks did not show any statistically significant differences for any of the two environments). Also, the perceived effort was significantly lower in three tasks when the participants used Code Cities over the tabular representation (again, the remaining tasks did not show any statistically significant differences). However, with regard to the perceived usability (which was measured across all tasks) and the correctness of the supplied answers, the tabular representation performed better. In particular, in two tasks the correctness was significantly better in the tabular environment and in one task the correctness was significantly better in the Code Cities environment. Based on our results, our verdict is as follows: Code Cities are better suited to get a quick overview of the code smells of a software, whereas tabular representations are better suited to analyze code smells in more detail.Experiment data, evaluation scripts and supplemental material: https://github.com/uni-bremen-agst/VISSOFT2022/archive/ refs/tags/1.0.0.zip (see README.md in the ZIP archive)",software visualization;code cities;tabular representation;code smells;controlled experiment
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Edge Animation in Software Visualization,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"An important aspect in software visualization is the visualization of relations between elements. Examples include function calls across source-code files, software clones, and the like. A popular means of visualizing such relations are edges depicted as lines visually connecting the related elements. To diminish the visual clutter that can occur when drawing a large number of edges, hierarchical edge bundles, based on B-Splines, have proven suitable. In addition to a purely static view of software, animations, both of the elements and the edges, can contribute to the usability of a visualization by making changes easier to track for users. In this paper we discuss how B-Splines can be used as a basis for a variety of edge layouts and how edges represented as B-Splines can be animated using B-Spline morphing. We also discuss the challenges of morphing B-Splines, especially of those whose shape does not result solely from the positions of the connected elements (e.g., straight lines), but whose structure depends on multiple aspects (e.g., hierarchical edge bundles) and provide a solution to make arbitrary B-Splines compatible for morphing. The practicality of edge animation is demonstrated by use cases which we already implemented or plan to implement in the future in our software visualization tool SEE.Supplemental material: https://github.com/tinyspline/vissoft2022/archive/refs/tags/1.0.0.zip (see README.md in the zip archive)",software visualization;hierarchical edge bundles;b-splines;spline morphing;edge animation
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Collaborative Software Visualization for Program Comprehension,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"In the context of program comprehension, learning and working in teams, e.g., via pair programming, shared documentation, and discussions, can facilitate the comprehension tasks. So far, team collaboration is a relatively unexplored aspect in software visualizations, in particular approaches which are designed and explored to enable collaborative program comprehension.In this paper, we introduce our collaboratively usable software visualization environment for program comprehension. Related approaches are often limited to single-user modes, therefore neglect the advantages of multi-user collaboration, or allow only the use of a single type of device. Our approach addresses this topic and allows users to collaboratively explore software visualizations in a device-heterogeneous environment. User events, e.g., sharable pop-up information windows, are synchronized between each session participant, regardless of the employed device.To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first approaches that combines on-screen, virtual reality, and augmented reality modes in a single web-based SV tool for program comprehension. We conducted a user study to collect initial results regarding the perceived usefulness and enjoyment of co-explored software cities In that study, 20 participants collaboratively solved program comprehension tasks while using each mode consecutively. The results indicate that the majority of participants find our approach useful and enjoyable, with AR being the least favored mode.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,IDEvelopAR: A Programming Interface to enhance Code Understanding in Augmented Reality,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"During software maintenance developers spend a considerable amount of time on tasks like navigating, identifying required code locations or tracing various call hierarchies. The classical tabbed interfaces, as found in modern IDEs, are not ideal for such tasks, leading to an inefficient workflow containing many context switches. Therefore, several programming environments, like Code Bubbles, were proposed to overcome these issues by allowing users to freely arrange code fragments on a canvas to make relations more explicit and better understand the codebase. Relations are made explicit using visual links or extra space between groups of code fragments. As a consequence, these approach quickly run out of screen space. In this paper, we present IDEVELOPAR, a tool to enhance code understanding in augmented reality. Due to the use of AR, a user is not restricted anymore by limited display sizes and can use the entire physical space as a workspace for placing and grouping code fragments as well as making changes to the codebase. First, we introduce the views and interactive functionalities of our tool. Next, we illustrate the usefulness of the tool by navigating an example program to locate and fix a bug. Finally, we briefly discuss the results of a cognitive walk-through using the cognitive dimension framework as well as a formative user study to identify potential usability problems. Moreover, in this study the participants also mentioned several advantages of our approach over the classical one. Furthermore, we found that over time the participants developed their own placement strategies.",augmented reality;programming tool;program comprehension;code navigation
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Improving the Comprehension of Evolving Graphical Models,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Context: Modeling industrial systems is mostly done collaboratively. In such a scenario, a model is modified by multiple people over a possibly long period of time. In consequence, modelers have to be able to understand a modelâ€™s evolution and, in particular, what elements of a model have changed, how, why, when, and by whom. Objective: We derive six distinct user goals and systematically design a graphical modeling languageagnostic set of tools that support users in achieving these goals. Method: We implement those tools and integrate them into an existing graphical modeling tool for technology roadmaps. To measure the toolsâ€™ usability, we conducted a mixed-methods study with participants of different levels of experience. With the set of developed tools at hand, in different scenarios, participants had to answer several questions regarding the evolution of a model. Results: The SUS score for assessing usability ranged from 80 to 95, indicating good to excellent usability. Task completeness (measured per scenario) ranged from 92% to 100%. Further, participants emphasized the added value of the tools while completing the scenarios. Conclusion: Although participants stated that the set of tools can be classified as expert tools, the developed tools achieve the goal of enabling users to comprehend changes made by others and trace the impacts of operations.",model evolution;graphical modeling;collaborative modeling;model explainability
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Visualizing Memory Consumption with Vismep,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Detecting and repairing memory issues is still a challenging task. One reason is that understanding a program's memory usage involves a diverse and related set of dynamic and static aspects. Over the years, multiple tools have been proposed to assist practitioners in these activities. However, detailed information about how a tool helps users when analyzing memory usage is missing.This article introduces Vismep, an interactive visualization prototype to help programmers analyze Python applications' memory usage, and presents an exploratory study to understand the behavior and perception of users when using Vismep. As a result, we reported five information needs when participants analyze memory consumption and how they use Vismep to satisfy these needs.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Utilizing Software Architecture Recovery to Explore Large-Scale Software Systems in Virtual Reality,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Exploring an unfamiliar large-scale software system is challenging, especially when based solely on source code. While software visualizations help in gaining an overview of a system, they generally neglect architecture knowledge in their representations, e.g., by arranging elements along package structures rather than functional components or locking users in a specific abstraction only slightly above the source code. In this paper, we introduce an automated approach for software architecture recovery and use its results in an immersive 3D virtual reality software visualization to aid accessing and relating architecture knowledge. We further provide a semantic zoom that allows a user to access and relate information both horizontally on the same abstraction level, e.g., by following method calls, and vertically across different abstraction levels, e.g., from a class to its containing component. We evaluate our contribution in a controlled experiment contrasting the usefulness regarding software exploration and comprehension of our concepts with those of the established CityVR visualization and the Eclipse IDE.",Software Visualization;Virtual Reality;Software Architecture Recovery;Empirical Software Engineering
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Git-Truck: Hierarchy-Oriented Visualization of Git Repository Evolution,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"The assessment of repository evolution is particularly complex when one needs to analyze both 1) how the codebase is organized hierarchically and 2) how this codebase evolves over time. To address this problem, we developed Git Truck, a visualization tool that includes multiple views for the analysis of the evolution of hierarchically organized Git repositories. We conducted a preliminary user evaluation with 18 participants who, using a remote and asynchronous method, installed Git Truck, used it, and filled in a questionnaire to report their experience and impressions. We learned that participants consider particularly useful views that help them with understanding the contribution level of team members and views that highlight the parts of the system that change the most. The participants see Git Truck as a highly specialized tool; not for daily use but rather for a lower frequency of use.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Dbux-PDG: An Interactive Program Dependency Graph for Data Structures and Algorithms,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Understanding and debugging of data structures and algorithms (DSA) is one of the most common tasks in computer science. DSA tests have also become a standard threshold that software developers have to cross to ""get the job"". One major challenge in comprehending and debugging DSA implementations lies in establishing and maintaining mental models of the quintessentially complex and twisted networks of events that make up their dynamic runtime behavior. Despite the high level of difficulty of this crucial task, general purpose tools to help users understand or reason about DSA implementations still have very limited capabilities. In this work we present Dbux-PDG, a dynamic Program Dependency Graph extension for the Dbux omniscient debugger. It captures data and control flow, as well as data dependencies of a programâ€™s execution for visualization and user interaction. To deal with the immense complexity of non-trivial programs, it offers multiple layers of summarization, that allow the user to explore either the graph as a whole or in parts, one step at a time, as they see fit. We present our findings from applying Dbux-PDG to 94 diverse algorithms and explore its utility in several case studies. All visual results are made available in an online gallery. Dbux-PDG is open source and one-click installable, making it a powerful, easy-to-use tool prototype for DSA comprehension.Video URL: https://youtu.be/dgXj3VoQJZQ",software visualization;algorithm visualization;program dependency graph;debugging;data dependencies;control flow;dynamic analysis
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Graph Buddy â€” an interactive code dependency browsing and visualization tool,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Source code comprehension of massively growing code bases is the first crucial step in todayâ€™s software development. One of the significant obstacles in reading the source code is understanding the code dependencies. To aid this process, we developed Graph Buddy, a tool integrated as a plugin for popular IDEs, which enables interactive visual code browsing as a graph of semantic code dependencies. To preserve the direct relation to the source code, visualize, and process only the right amount of details, we have developed Semantic Code Graph (SCG), an information model underlying Graph Buddy, capable of representing detailed code semantics. We implemented the SCG model extraction for the Scala and Java languages. To evaluate Graph Buddy, we conducted a user survey on a group of 10 programmers who used the tool in three programming-related tasks. The survey indicates that the tasks would be difficult to solve without the visual browsing tool. We believe that the proposed solution has a strong potential to enhance the way programmers comprehend code dependencies.",software visualization;semantic code graph;static analysis;scala;java
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Bug-Fix Variants: Visualizing Unique Source Code Changes across GitHub Forks,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Forking is a common practice for developers when building upon on already existing projects. These forks create variants, which have a common code base but then evolve the code in different directions, which is specific to that forked project requirements. An interesting side-effect of having multiple forks is the ability to select between different evolution directions of the code which is based on developers fixing bugs in the code base. However, the key issue that this decentralized form of information is difficult to analyze. In this study, we propose a visualization to analyze active changes in fork repositories that have not been merged back to the original project. Our visualization shows code commit activities in multiple forks with highlight on bug fix commits in the history of forks. While the commit activity of each repository is visualized similarly to the code frequency view of GitHub, our view shows only commits unique to fork repositories. To illustrate the effectiveness of our visualization, we have applied our view to two use cases: identifying forks from a repository no longer maintained, and identifying a bug fix among forks. In the first case, we identify a fork of a suspended project named Obfuscator-LLVM. Our view shows the original repository and its most active fork that continue the development on the top. In the second case, we identify a bug fix in a fork of Clipy project. Our view shows that the most active fork has its own bug fixes; we could easily identify a patch for the bug highlighted in the view. As a new ideas paper, we then present our outline of three research questions to spark real world use-cases and goals for our visualization has the potential to uncover.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Heap Patterns for Memory Graph Visualization,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Visualizing large memory graphs containing dynamic data structures and nested payload data is crucial when debugging legacy and modern software. However, existing visualization tools primarily focus on aggregating data structures and either rely on hard-coded patterns, generic heuristics, or predicates written in expressive logics. We present a novel heap pattern language for concisely and intuitively describing structural aspects of dynamic data structures and nested payload data. Evaluating a heap pattern on a memory graph yields a set of matching groups of interconnected objects, and analyzing these groups enables the construction of a multi-level hierarchy for memory graph visualization, where groups can individually be (un)folded to the desired level of detail. We have prototypically implemented our heap pattern language in the Memory Graph Explorer tool and illustrate its use for visualizing large memory graphs on real-world and textbook examples. Unlike existing tools, developers can now control the construction of hierarchies using heap patterns to flexibly and locally adjust the level of memory graph abstraction in an interactive graph visualization to highlight the areas demanding attention during debugging.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Spike â€“ A code editor plugin highlighting fine-grained changes,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Information about source code changes is important for many software development activities. As such, modern IDEs, including, IntelliJ IDEA and Visual Studio Code, show visual clues within the code editor that highlight lines that have been changed since the last synchronization with the code repository. However, the granularity of the change information is limited to a line level, showing mainly a small colored icon on the left side of the lines that have been added, deleted, or modified.This paper introduces Spike, a source code highlighting plugin that uses the font color to visually encode fine-grained version difference information within the code editor. In contrast to previously mentioned tools, Spike can highlight insertions, deletions, updates, and refactorings all in a same line. Our plugin also enriches the source code with small icons that allow retrieving detailed information about a given code change. We perform an exploratory user study with five professional software engineers. Our results show that our approach is able to assist practitioners with complex comprehension tasks about software history within the code editor.",Code highlighting;software evolution;software visualization

Libraries make available intended API surfacesâ€”sets of exposed library interfaces that library developers expect clients to use. However, in practice, clients only use small fractions of intended API surfaces of libraries. We have implemented the VizAPI tool, which shows a visualization that includes both static and dynamic interactions between clients, the libraries they use, and those librariesâ€™ transitive dependencies (all written in Java). We then present some usage scenarios of VizAPI, targetted at library upgrades. One application, by client developers, is to answer a query about upstream code: will their code be affected by breaking changes in library APIs? Or, library developers can use VizAPI to find out about downstream code: which APIs in their source code are commonly used by clients?",static program analysis;dynamic program analysis;API usage;software evolution;software maintenance

Usually the target audience of such tools comprises software engineering professionals. In this paper we argue that such tools are also beneficial for educators who need to evaluate the quality of software systems developed by students. However, since the needs of educators are different than those of the software engineering professionals, we discuss several educator needs first. We report several usage examples that we believe are useful for educators when using repository visualization tools. We illustrate them with examples from several student projects from different courses in two universities. We conclude with a series of considerations that should be heeded by both educators and future tool-builders.",

IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,A Scalable Log Differencing Visualisation Applied to COBOL Refactoring,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Large code refactoring projects can consist of hundreds of refactoring rules that are applied iteratively to make code easier to maintain. Visualising the refactoring process can help engineers and stakeholders understand how chains of refactorings were applied and to gain more confidence in the produced result. An apparently suitable existing visualisation using log-based behavioural differencing suffers from scalability issues when applied to industrial-size cases. We propose an adapted visualisation tool that highlights those parts that really changed in-between iterations of a large refactoring process and collapses those parts that remain stable. We show that our alternative visualisation scales well on large logs of a process with many possible refactoring chains, of which significant parts are shared. Consequently, it allows engineers and stakeholders to quickly answer relevant questions about what happened during the refactoring process.",Differencing;Visualisation;Logs;Refactoring;COBOL;Scalability;Industrial
IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,CodeCity: On-Screen or in Virtual Reality?,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Over the past decades, researchers proposed numerous approaches to visualize source code. A prominent one is CodeCity, an interactive 3D software visualization that leverages the ""city metaphor"" to represent software system as cities: buildings represent classes (or files) and districts represent packages (or folders). Building dimensions represent values of software metrics, such as the number of methods or the lines of code. There are many implementations of CodeCity, the vast majority of them running on-screen. Recently, some implementations visualizing CodeCity in virtual reality (VR) have appeared. While exciting as a technology, VRâ€™s usefulness remains to be proven.The question we pose is: Is VR well suited to visualize CodeCity, compared to the traditional on-screen implementation?We performed an experiment in our interactive web-based application to visualize CodeCity. Users can fetch data from any git repository and visualize its source code. Our application enables users to navigate CodeCity both on-screen and in an immersive VR environment, using consumer-grade VR headsets like Oculus Quest. Our controlled experiment involved 24 participants from academia and industry. Results show that people using the VR version performed the assigned tasks in much less time, while still maintaining a comparable level of correctness.Therefore, our results show that VR is at least equally well-suited as on-screen for visualizing CodeCity, and likely better.",codecity;city metaphor;software visualization;software evolution;reverse engineering;virtual reality;web;3D
IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,Codingâ„¢: Development Task Visualization for SW Code Comprehension,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"In a software development project, a developer tends to use the â€˜diffâ€™ view of the version control system (VCS) to understand development tasks such as fixing bugs, adding new features, and refactoring. However, the view only shows the difference of resources between the recent and previous versions in a commit, without providing any information about associated updates for completing a specific task. This causes a developer to spend a lot of time understanding development tasks, especially in the project where source code should be shared throughout team members. In order to handle this issue, we propose a novel tool Coding Time-Machine, in short Codingâ„¢, that automatically identifies and visualizes development tasks and their associated task elements (e.g., class and method). Codingâ„¢ extracts development tasks composed of task elements and causal relationships between them in a commit and facilitates one to compare the recent version of a code to the previous for each task. In addition, it allows one to navigate tasks of all commits in the code repository so that a developer feels like carrying out the time-travel of the coding activities in the software development project. For the evaluation, we measured the performance of tasks extracted from Codingâ„¢ for eight open-source Java projects, and obtained 0.87 of precision and 0.88 of recall. Also, we surveyed the usefulness of our tool for 20 participants, 80% of participants thought that showing tasks and their associated elements in a commit helps one to comprehend source code, and all participants responded that showing tasks in a chronicle way facilitates one to understand coding activities.",SW code comprehension;Commit History;Development Task
IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,Continuous Rationale Visualization,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Continuous software engineering (CSE) is characterized by frequent changes. It is challenging for developers to change software while sustaining its high quality so that the software is always deployable to the users. Rationale management provides an opportunity to support the change process during CSE. However, rationale management is not well integrated into CSE. Even if the rationale is captured, e. g. in the issue tracking system, it is difficult to access in the context of requirements, code, and other software artifacts. In this paper, we present tool support called ConDec to make rationale explicit during CSE and to integrate rationale into a knowledge graph data structure consisting of requirements, code, and other software artifacts. The knowledge graph is visualized in various ways and the developers can access the knowledge views from software artifacts such as requirements and code. They can interact with and filter the knowledge views. In particular, they can use transitive links, for example, to access all the decisions made in the context of a particular requirement or code file. We demonstrate the usefulness of the knowledge views using a case study project.",knowledge visualization;knowledge graph;rationale;decision knowledge;ConDec;traceability visualization;rationale management;change impact analysis;documentation quality
IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,Global Overviews of Granular Test Coverage with Matrix Visualizations,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Existing IDE-based tools that are available to developers make understanding software testing difficult for a software system, for both granular tasks (e.g., answering questions such as, ""which test cases execute this method?"") and global tasks (e.g., answering questions such as, ""what is the proportion of unit tests to system tests?""). IDE-based tools typically support local, file-based views of a projectâ€™s test suite, and rarely offer a global overview. Global overviews can provide a larger context for a methodâ€™s execution by test cases; help identify other similar, or related methods; and even reveal similarity between individual tests. This work approaches such challenges with a novel, interactive, matrix-based visual interface that provides a global overview of a software projectâ€™s test suite, specifically in the context of the methods available in the projectâ€™s codebase. Through a series of interactive functions to sort, filter, query, and explore a test-matrix visualization, we demonstrate how developers can effectively answer questions about their projectâ€™s test suite, and the code executed by such tests. Our evaluations, performed on four real-world software systems, show that the interactive visualization assisted developers to answer questions about software tests and the code they execute. Further, the visualization consistently outperforms traditional development tools, both in accuracy and time taken to complete software-engineering tasks.",Software Testing;Visualization;Software Comprehension;Software Test Comprehension
IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,Trace Visualization within the Software City Metaphor: A Controlled Experiment on Program Comprehension,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Especially with the rise of microservice architectures, software is hard to understand when just the static dependencies are known. The reason is that the actual call paths and the dynamic behavior of the application is hidden behind network communication. To comprehend what is going on in the software the vast amount of runtime data (traces) needs to be reduced and visualized.DynaCity uses the city metaphor for visualization. Its novel trace visualization displays dynamic dependencies as arcs atop the city. To reduce the number of traces, DynaCity aggregates all requests between the same two components into one arc whose brightness reflects both the number and the total duration of the requests. DynaCity also encodes dynamic trace data in a heatmap that it uses to light up the building: the brighter a building is, the more active it is, i.e., the more and the longer the requests are that it receives and/or spawns.In a controlled experiment, we compare our approach with a traditional trace visualization built into the same Software City but showing all dependencies (without aggregation) as individual arcs and also disabling the heatmap. The study shows that professional software developers can solve typical software comprehension tasks faster (5.84%) and more correctly (11.7%) with the help of DynaCity and that they prefer our approach over the more traditional dynamic trace visualization.",trace visualization;software city;program comprehension;aggregation;heatmap
IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,TransVis: Using Visualizations and Chatbots for Supporting Transient Behavior in Microservice Systems,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"In a microservice system, runtime changes such as failures, deployments, or self-adaptation can trigger the system to transition from one steady state to another, i.e., exhibiting transient behavior. To assess a systemâ€™s quality, it is imperative that this transient behavior is specified in non-functional requirements and that stakeholders can analyze whether these requirements are met. Yet, there is little support for either specifying transient behavior as a non-functional requirement or analyzing how such a requirement is met in production. We aim to make these two tasks more accessible by utilizing novel human-computer interaction methods. To this end, we developed TransVis, an approach for specifying and analyzing transient behavior based on chatbot interactions and visualizations of the systemsâ€™ resilience. We examined the effectiveness of our approach by conducting an exploratory expert study on a prototypical implementation. The study revealed that the developed visualizations are effective for specifying and exploring transient behavior. Participants found especially helpful the feature to compare specifications with the actual behavior. However, the integration of a chatbot did not prove effective for our use cases. In conclusion, our approach is capable of supporting stakeholders in the exploration and specification of transient behavior.",transient behavior;microservices;requirements;software quality;visualization;chatbots
IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,Visualization of Object-Oriented Variability Implementations as Cities,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Many large software systems are variability-rich, object-oriented, and implemented in a single code base. They then rely on multiple traditional techniques (inheritance, patterns) to realize variability, making these implementations not explicit. This directly hampers the comprehension of variability implementations, especially for newcomers in a project that need, in a short time, to understand the most important parts. In this paper, we propose VariCity, a visualization using the city metaphor to exhibit zones of interest, being zones of high density of variability implementations. The different forms of variability implementations are first detected through the usage of symmetries in code (e.g., inheritance defines a substitution symmetry between the immutable part of the superclass and the possible changes in its subclasses). VariCity then creates a 3D city representation with buildings being classes while the metrics on the number of symmetries (e.g., the number of overloaded methods, influence the building size, and their color if they are heavily loaded in symmetries). Contrary to the usual package-based organization in code-related city representations, the city streets are arranged according to the usage relationships between classes. Inheritance is simply represented with hoverable aerial links. Variability-related design patterns are depicted as buildings with specific geometric forms, while some classes specified as entry points can help in shaping the whole city organization. We also report on the evaluation of VariCity on a set of large object-oriented systems, showing that several usage scenarios helping a newcomer to spot critical variability-related zones are covered.",variability;software visualization;software cities

Ensuring high-quality standards across these entire portfolios raises additional challenges for quality engineers and requires new strategies and visualization approaches to support software quality management decisions. In this paper, we study the information needs of software quality engineers that drive these decisions on portfolio-level and propose Portfoliotrix -an expert visualization prototype for a portfolio-wide analysis and comparison of software quality metric trends. For this, we first introduce our four-phase fully automated data-mining process for gathering and aggregating quality metric data from the underlying software repositories. We then present our application frontend that implements different visualization and filtering concepts to satisfy eight specific information needs derived from our prior qualitative semi-structured expert interviews. A final scenario-based expert evaluation confirms the practical relevance of our prototype. Experts took less time to complete quality-related management tasks with our tool than they had estimated when relying only upon existing toolsets.

In addition to the analysis and visualization of software systems, it is useful to analyze the software development process to obtain better information about the quality, reliability, and trustworthiness of the software. To gain insights and knowledge about software development processes, we extract the provenance of development processes, especially from version control systems for Git-based software projects, and visualize the provenance information using graph visualization, metrics representation, and development timelines; including an integration of these methods into a web-based dashboard. With the help of visual provenance representations, project managers can gain an overview and insights into development progress, effects of process changes, and interactions among developers and with external contributors, which we exemplify with a case study of a software with high social relevance.",provenance;software visualization;software development processes;visual analytics;interactive dashboards

IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,Augmenting Code Review Experience Through Visualization,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Code review is a systematic inspection of the code-base. It ensures that the software satisfies the required functionalities and standards; thus, it is an essential stage in the modern development process and is used frequently in the industry. For a successful review, the reviewer should be able to identify defects; therefore, the process is highly dependent on the awareness of the reviewer. Currently, code review is done by comparing the line-by-line differences on the codebase. However, this does not give structural information, such as design pattern changes or dependency changes between services.To address this problem, we propose an augmented next-generation code review experience using visual and holistic approaches to streamline the reviewing process. The proposed code review experience shows the structural representation of the change by visualizing it into a UML-like relationship diagram. Along with this diagram, the risk percentage for each commit is highlighted to emphasize the differences that possibly can be most affected by the change. An artifact map is also produced that includes issue-commit relation for bug tracking, to make reviewers aware of the frequent issues that are brought up. This map also highlights the change frequency of the files, for focusing the reviewers on the possibly vulnerable parts of the software for better quality reviews.

Performing an effective code review is a challenging task for developers. Two of the main challenges reviewers face are (1) understanding the content of a review change-set and (2) assessing the impact of a change on the codebase. Visualization techniques can be used to increase developersâ€™ understanding of a changeset to review and its context. However, only a few attempts have been made to apply visualization to code review.In this paper, we present a novel approach we devised to support developers in understanding GitHub pull requests.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,Live Visualization of Dynamic Software Cities with Heat Map Overlays,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"The 3D city metaphor in software visualization is a well-explored rendering method. Numerous tools use their custom variation to visualize offline-analyzed data. Heat map overlays are one of these variants. They introduce a separate information layer in addition to the software cityâ€™s own semantics. Results show that their usage facilitates program comprehension.In this paper, we present our heat map approach for the city metaphor visualization based on live trace analysis. In comparison to previous approaches, our implementation uses live dynamic analysis of a software systemâ€™s runtime behavior. At any time, users can toggle the heat map feature and choose which runtime-dependent metric the heat map should visualize. Our approach continuously and automatically renders both software cities and heat maps. It does not require a manual or semiautomatic generation of heat maps and seamlessly blends into the overall software visualization. We implemented this approach in our web-based tool ExplorViz, such that the heat map overlay is also available in our augmented reality environment.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,Towards a JSON-based Algorithm Animation Language,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Visual algorithm simulation (VAS) is a method used in teaching data structures and algorithms. In a VAS exercise a learner simulates the steps of an algorithm by interacting with data structure visualisations and receives feedback on the correctness of steps taken. A data format for storing VAS simulation traces would allow for later inspection of the process by instructors and researchers. In this study we describe the development of a prototype language for this purpose. The initial version was tested in a research project where the language was used for recording traces, which were later analyzed. The results were positive but also instructed some revisions in the data format and the requirements. We describe an iterative development process for extending and improving the language and the tooling.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,Understanding High-Level Behavior with a Light-Traces Visualization Metaphor,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,We propose to exploit a visualization metaphor and a set of filters to assist developers grasping high-level behaviors of programs. Our interactive visualization is based on a metaphor of light-traces as part of an animation to explore execution scenarios. The animation is augmented with a set of structural and temporal filters to reduce the volume of information displayed. We showcase our visualization environment on two case studies featuring programs of a chess game and a UML diagram editor.,software visualization;interaction;execution trace;filters;edge bundles
IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,Visualizing Data in Software Cities,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"The city metaphor for visualizing software systems in 3D has been widely explored and it has led to many diverse implementations and approaches. However, when looking at software systems in general, and when using specifically a city approach, it is evident that something is missing: The data. Indeed, software systems are intrinsically driven by data, which is usually managed using databases or often also simply stored in files coming in a variety of formats, such as CSV, XML, and JSON. While such data files are part of a projectâ€™s file system and can thus be easily retrieved, the situation is different for databases: A database is usually not contained in the file system, and its presence can only be inferred from the source code which contains the database accesses.We present an extension of the CodeCity implementation, M3TRICITY2, with two new contributions: First, we consider data files and use simple metrics to integrate them in the visualization seamlessly. Second, we present a novel way to add a database to the visualization by making use of the one remaining space left unused: the sky and the underground. We present our contributions and illustrate them on various software systems.",Software visualization;Database access visualization;Software maintenance;CodeCity
IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,Visualizing Discord Servers,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"The last decade has seen the rise of global software community platforms, such as Slack, Gitter, and Discord. They allow developers to discuss implementation issues, report bugs, and, in general, interact with one another. Such real-time communication platforms are thus slowly complementing, if not replacing, more traditional communication channels, such as development mailing lists. Apart from simple text messaging and conference calls, they allow the sharing of any type of content, such as videos, images, and source code. This is turning such platforms into precious information sources when it comes to searching for documentation and understanding design and implementation choices. However, the velocity and volatility of the contents shared and discussed on such platforms, combined with their often informal structure, makes it difficult to grasp and differentiate the relevant pieces of information.We present a visual analytics approach, supported by a tool named DiscOrDance, which provides numerous custom views to support the understanding of Discord servers in terms of their structure, contents, and community. We illustrate DiscOrDance, using as running example the public Pharo development community Discord Server, which counts to date âˆ¼180k messages shared among âˆ¼2,900 developers, spanning 5 years of history. Based on our analyses, we distill and discuss interesting insights and lessons learned.",visualization;software communities;Discord
IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,Visualizing GitHub Issues,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"The rise of distributed version control systems, such as git, and platforms built on top of it, such as GitHub, has triggered a change in how software is developed. Most notably, state-of-the-art practice foresees the use of pull requests and issues, enriched by means to enable discussions among the involved people. Platforms like GitHub and GitLab have thus turned into comprehensive and cohesive modern software development environments, also offering additional mechanisms, such as code review tools and a transversal support for continuous integration and deployment. However, the plethora of concepts, mechanisms, and their interconnections are stored and presented in textual form, which makes the understanding of the underlying evolutionary processes difficult.We introduce the notion of an issue tale, a visual narrative of the events and actors revolving around any GitHub issue, and present an approach, implemented as an interactive visual analytics tool, to depict and analyze the relevant information pertaining to issue tales. We illustrate our approach and its implementation on several open-source software systems.",software evolution visualization;visual analytics;github issues
IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,Visually Analyzing the Structure and Code Quality of Component-based Web Applications,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Monitoring code quality and dependencies is an important task to keep software maintainable. While generally well researched, only little work on visually analyzing code quality of component-based front-end web applications exists that considers the specifics of such software systems. We propose an approach to visualize dependencies and code quality metrics of component-based JavaScript React applications. Our prototype implementation uses a node-link diagram for dependency visualization, tailored to the specific component structure of React applications and enriched with various visual cues. It is linked with different panels to show code quality and exact source code locations. Recommendations on how the quality of the system under analysis can be improved and refactored are provided. We evaluated our prototype in a small user study with four participants and found that it helped in program comprehension tasks and finding refactoring opportunities.",JavaScript;React;software visualization;code quality metrics;dependency graph;refactorings
IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,Voronoi Evolving Treemaps,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Since their invention, treemaps have been widely used to visualize hierarchical structures, due to their intuitive nature and their scaling capability: Indeed, given a maximum treemap size, one can depict hierarchical structures, such as file and software systems, of arbitrary size and depth. To make up for the rather blocky nature of treemaps, Voronoi treemaps were introduced, leading to depictions that look more ""organic"". However, hierarchical structures in general, evolve over time, and this is especially the case for software.We present Voronoi Evolving Treemaps (VET), a novel approach inspired by the Voronoi power-weighted treemap algorithm, that takes into account the evolution of hierarchical structures. VET is able to display the complete evolution of a software system in terms of its hierarchical structure, and enriches the visualization with additional information. We detail VETâ€™s evolutionary layout algorithm, discuss the architecture, implementation, and the features of VET, and illustrate how VET can be used to analyze the evolution of different systems.",software visualization;software evolution;treemap;layout;voronoi;power-weight

Automatically generated unit tests are known to be an important asset to identify software defects and define oracles. However, configuring the test generation is a tedious activity for a practitioner due to the inherent difficulty to adequately tuning the generation process. This paper presents TestEvoViz, a visual technique to introspect the generation of unit tests using genetic algorithms. TestEvoViz offers the practitioners a visual support to expose some of the decisions made by the test generation.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,Visualization of Evolution of Component-Based Software Architectures in Virtual Reality,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"The visualization of software architectures by the use of effective and feasible visual metaphors provides an intuitive approach to comprehend the implemented architecture of a software project. In this regard not only the visualization of the latest status of the implemented architecture is important, but also the visualization of the history of software architectures. Such visualizations show dependencies and contexts in which design decisions were made. Resulting information supports programmers to understand systems and to recognize disadvantageous design decisions. A software which is particularly suited for the visualization of component-based software is IslandViz. This software visualizes OSGi-based software architectures in Virtual Reality with an island metaphor, but at this point the history of an architecture is not taken into account. In this paper we present how IslandViz can be extended to visualize the history of software architectures of OSGi-based software projects. For this purpose we use algorithms for dynamic graphs to realize a dynamic positioning of the islands and an adaptable layout of the regions on the islands. The aim is to ensure that the user's orientation in the virtual environment is preserved even if elements of the visualization must adapt due to changes in the software history.",software visualization;software architecture;software evolution;history of software;virtual reality
IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,Visualizing Evolving Software Cities,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Visualization approaches that leverage a 3D city metaphor have become popular. Numerous variations, including virtual and augmented reality have emerged. Despite its popularity, the city metaphor falls short when depicting the evolution of a system, which results in buildings and districts moving around in unpredictable ways. We present a novel approach to visualize software systems as evolving cities that treats evolution as a first-class concept. It renders with fidelity not only changes but also refactorings in a comprehensive way. To do so, we developed custom ways to traverse time.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,Exploring Developer Preferences for Visualizing External Information Within Source Code Editors,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Developers increasingly rely on external tools and services which causes development information to be scattered across different information silos. To access this information, developers need to access different applications, presentation files, and web services. This paper investigates mechanisms for incorporating external information sources into Integrated Development Environments using visual mechanisms to support common software development activities. Through a developer survey and a small experiment we find that developers prefer minimal representations for incorporating external information sources into their source code editors, and that they are able to use this information when performing their development tasks.",Integrated Development Environments;external information;actionable information;information overload
IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,Visualizing Interaction Data Inside & Outside the IDE to Characterize Developer Productivity,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Work fragmentation is a common phenomenon in the workspace, and is detrimental to the actual work taking place. To measure and study the impact of work fragmentation in software development, several studies exploited interaction data, i.e., the data generated by the events performed by the developers in the IDE. However, the absence of information on activities performed outside the IDE could lead to a misclassification of development time. In fact, sometimes leaving the IDE is not an interruption of the task at hand, e.g., when consulting API documentation, or when discussing with colleagues in ad-hoc collaboration applications. In this paper, we propose Ferax, a data analytics platform that developers can leverage for retrospection and possibly to improve their productivity. The capabilities of Ferax are twofold: First, it extends Tako, a profiler to record IDE interaction data for Visual Studio Code, with information about which applications were used and which websites were visited. Second, to enable the understanding of productivity and interruptions on developer sessions, Ferax provides interactive visualizations that show the detailed sequence of events inside and outside the IDE, the switches the developer performs by classifying them as productive or possible interruptions, and the time distribution for application usage. As a preliminary evaluation of Ferax we have collected and analyzed real development sessions from a set of master students and two professional developers. We illustrate how a developer can leverage Ferax to characterize her usual habits, to elicit the impact of interruptions, and to better characterize sessions which were only apparently unproductive.",interaction data;development productivity
IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,Enhanced Visualization of Method Invocations by Extending Reverse-engineered Sequence Diagrams,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Software} maintainers employ reverse-engineered sequence diagrams to visually understand software behavior, especially when software documentation is absent or outdated. Much research has studied the adoption of reverse-engineered sequence diagrams to visualize program interactions. However, due to the forward-engineering nature of sequence diagrams, visualizing more complex programming scenarios can be challenging. In particular, sequence diagrams represent method invocations as unidirectional arrows. However, in practice, source code may contain compound method invocations that share values/objects implicitly. For example, method invocations can be nested, e.g., fun (foo ()), or chained, e.g., fun (). foo (). The standard notation of sequence diagrams does not have enough expressive power to precisely represent compound scenarios of method invocations. Understanding the flow of information between method invocations simplifies debugging, inspection, and exception handling operations for software maintainers. Despite the research invested to address the limitations of UML sequence diagrams, previous approaches fail to visualize compound scenarios of method invocations. In this paper, we propose sequence diagram extensions to enhance the visualization of (i) three widely used types of compound method invocations in practice (i.e., nested, chained, and recursive) and (ii) lifelines of objects returned from method invocations. We aim through our extensions to increase the level of abstraction and expressiveness of method invocation code. We develop a tool to reverse engineer compound method invocations and generate the corresponding extended sequence diagrams. We evaluate how our proposed extensions can improve the understandability of program interactions using a controlled experiment. We find that program interactions are significantly more comprehensible when visualized using our extensions.",Sequence diagram;extended notation;program comprehension;method invocation;controlled experiment
IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,REM: Visualizing the Ripple Effect on Dependencies Using Metrics of Health,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"In recent years, free and open source software (FOSS) components have become common dependencies in the development of software, both open source and proprietary. As the complexity of software increases, so does the number of components they depend upon; in addition, components are also depending on other components. Thus, their dependency graphs are growing in size and complexity. One of the current challenges in software development is that it is not trivial to know the full dependency graph of an application. Developers are usually aware of the direct dependencies their application requires, but might not be fully aware of the dependencies that those dependencies require (the transitive dependencies). Unfortunately, transitive dependencies can break any software application; therefore, project developers need tools, methods and visualizations to inspect the health of these transitive dependencies and their potential impact.In this work, we propose the Ripple Effect of Metrics (REM) dependency graphs, a visualization of dependency graphs that leverages metrics of the health of dependencies. The two main features of REM dependency graph are: first, to display, and potentially summarize, the full dependency graph of an application based on the health of each of its dependencies; and second, to evaluate the ripple effect of potentially risky dependencies on the rest of the dependency graph. The REM helps application developers inspect the health of all of its dependencies, and also the impact that some of these dependencies might have. By showcasing two examples of popular NPM JavaScript application, we demonstrate that the combination of the ripple effect on the dependency graph using health metrics activity can be beneficial to developers. The advantages of REM graphs are: 1) the metric of health annotation is useful for evaluating the health of dependencies, and 2) the ripple effect of a vulnerability provides an easy method to identify potential risk in a dependency chain and 3) the summarizing mechanisms of the REM help reduce the size and complexity of the large dependency graphs, while focusing in specific aspects of the health of the dependency graph.",Dependency graph;Software components;Metrics;Health
IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,N-way Diff: Set-based Comparison of Software Variants,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Software is frequently developed in many similar copies, called forks or cloned software variants. During this development, pairwise comparison is routinely used for finding differences between the cloned copies, assessing their similarity, and merging the content. However, analyzing the similarity of a large group of variants using pairwise comparison is a relatively difficult task, as the number of compared pairs grows quadratically with the number of variants. Furthermore, the result of such group of pairwise comparisons is difficult to visualize. In this paper, we discuss the problem of N-way comparison of cloned software variants. We represent the N-way comparison result as a model of N intersecting sets. By aggregating the sets along the system decomposition hierarchy, we construct the sets at every level of the system structure (files, folders, and whole systems). We define a generalized approach for set model construction, and instantiate it for an N-way diff on the textual code representation. We propose set-based visualizations for the N-way comparison, which scale for more than ten component variants and MLOC-sized components. We evaluate the approach by applying it to several groups of industrial software system variants and by performing a controlled experiment with a comparison of 5 software forks. In the experiment, the group using set-based comparison solved the tasks in 58% less time and with 92% fewer incorrect answers than the group using pairwise comparison. Finally, we propose a generalization of the approach beyond software, to enable set-based comparison and similarity visualization for hierarchically structured models and data, for example genomes.",software comparison;software reuse;similarity;set model;set visualization;software variability;product lines
IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,Interactive Visualization for OSGi-based Projects,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Big software projects often use architectural frameworks for a consistent structure. OSGi is such a framework to create modular Java applications. The architecture of individual projects, however, is often hidden in configuration files. We propose to visualize projects in a modular framework such as OSGi with an approach to allow users to comprehend the connections within a system. We assist this comprehension using filtering and automatically generated, interactive views of the project. We extend the notion of interactive views with a concept to reproduce configured views for arbitrary system revisions to enhance up-to-date documentation. We have implemented this proposal in the publicly available KIELER project, and have validated it with a large software project in the railway domain.","OSGi, visualization, interactive, software architecture, documentation"
IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,Clustering Paths With Dynamic Time Warping,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Studying software visualization often includes the evaluation of paths collected from participants of a study (e.g., eye tracking or movements in virtual worlds). In this paper, we explore clustering techniques to automate the process of grouping similar paths. The heart of the evaluated approach is a distance metric between paths that is based on dynamic time warping (DTW). DTW aligns two paths based on any given distance metric between their data points so as to minimize the distance between those paths-alignment may stretch or compress time for best fit. With a data set of 127 paths of professional software developers exploring code cities in virtual reality, we evaluate the clustering based on objective quality indices and manual inspection.",dynamic time warping;clustering;path data;time series
IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,Identifying Usability Issues of Software Analytics Applications in Immersive Augmented Reality,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Software analytics in augmented reality (AR) is said to have great potential. One reason why this potential is not yet fully exploited may be usability problems of the AR user interfaces. We present an iterative and qualitative usability evaluation with 15 subjects of a state-of-the-art application for software analytics in AR. We could identify and resolve numerous usability issues. Most of them were caused by applying conventional user interface elements, such as dialog windows, buttons, and scrollbars. The used city visualization, however, did not cause any usability issues. Therefore, we argue that future work should focus on making conventional user interface elements in AR obsolete by integrating their functionality into the immersive visualization.",usability evaluation;software analytics;software visualization;augmented reality;mixed reality

In addition, it is well established that cognitive processes can be monitored by recording the change in pupil dilation. Recent pupillometry studies in the software engineering field have shown that pupil dilation can be used either as an indicator of cognitive load or task difficulty. We envision to create a tool for visualizing pupil dilation linked to source code artifacts that can help to better understand the cognitive processes of a developer during code comprehension tasks in terms of cognitive load. In this paper, we describe a feasibility study we conducted to enable a more fine-grained analysis of pupil dilation and we demonstrate some preliminary results.",pupil dilation;code comprehension;cognitive load
IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,Memory Cities: Visualizing Heap Memory Evolution Using the Software City Metaphor,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Tool support is essential to help developers in understanding the memory behavior of complex software systems. Anomalies such as memory leaks can dramatically impact application performance and can even lead to crashes. Unfortunately, most memory analysis tools lack advanced visualizations (especially of the memory evolution over time) that could facilitate developers in analyzing suspicious memory behavior.In this paper, we present Memory Cities, a technique to visualize an application's heap memory evolution over time using the software city metaphor. While this metaphor is typically used to visualize static artifacts of a software system such as class hierarchies, we use it to visualize the dynamic memory behavior of an application. In our approach, heap objects can be grouped by multiple properties such as their types or their allocation sites. The resulting object groups are visualized as buildings arranged in districts, where the size of a building corresponds to the number of heap objects or bytes it represents. Continuously updating the city over time creates the immersive feeling of an evolving city. This can be used to detect and analyze memory leaks, i.e., to search for suspicious growth behavior. Memory cities further utilize various visual attributes to ease this task. For example, they highlight strongly growing buildings using color, while making less suspicious buildings semi-transparent.We implemented memory cities as a standalone application developed in Unity, with a JSON-based interface to ensure easy data import from external tools. We show how memory cites can use data provided by AntTracks, a trace-based memory monitoring tool, and present case studies on different applications to demonstrate the tool's applicability and feasibility.",Memory City;Software City;Software Map;Visualization Metaphor;Heap Memory Evolution;Memory Leak Analysis;3D Visualization;Interactive Analysis System
IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,Interactive Role Stereotype-Based Visualization To Comprehend Software Architecture,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Motivation: Software visualization can be helpful in comprehending the architecture of large software systems. Traditionally, software visualisation focuses on representing the structural perspectives of systems. In this paper we enrich this perspective by adding the notion of role-stereotype. This rolestereotype carries information about the type of functionality that a class has in the system as well as the types of collaborations with other classes that it typically has.Objective: We propose an interactive visualization called RoleViz, that visualizes system architectures in which architectural elements are annotated with their role-stereotypes.Method: We conducted a user-study in which developers use RoleViz and Softagram (a commercial tool for software architecture comprehension) to solve two separate comprehension tasks on a large open source system. We compared RoleViz against Softagram in terms of participant's: (i) perceived cognitive load, (ii) perceived usability, and (iii) understanding of the system. Result: In total, 16 developers participated in our study. Six of the participants explicitly indicated that visualizing roles helped them complete the assigned tasks. Our observations indicate significant differences in terms of participant's perceived usability and understanding scores.Conclusion: The participants achieved better scores on completing software understanding tasks with RoleViz without any cognitive-load penalty.",

IEEE,conferencePaper,2019,Performance Evolution Matrix: Visualizing Performance Variations Along Software Versions,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Software performance may be significantly affected by source code modifications. Understanding the effect of these changes along different software versions is a challenging and necessary activity to debug performance failures. It is not sufficiently supported by existing profiling tools and visualization approaches. Practitioners would need to manually compare calling context trees and call graphs. We aim at better supporting the comparison of benchmark executions along multiple software versions. We propose Performance Evolution Matrix, an interactive visualization technique that contrasts runtime metrics to source code changes. It combines a comparison of time series data and execution graphs in a matrix layout, showing performance and source code metrics at different levels of granularity. The approach guides practitioners from the high-level identification of a performance regression to the changes that might have caused the issue. We conducted a controlled experiment with 12 participants to provide empirical evidence of the viability of our method. The results indicate that our approach can reduce the effort for identifying sources of performance regressions compared to traditional profiling visualizations.",Performance;Software Visualization;software evolution;performance regression
IEEE,conferencePaper,2019,Evo-Clocks: Software Evolution at a Glance,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Understanding the evolution of a project is crucial in reverse-engineering, auditing and otherwise understanding existing software. Visualizing how software evolves can be challenging, as it typically abstracts a multi-dimensional graph structure where individual components undergo frequent but localized changes. Existing approaches typically consider either only a small number of revisions or they focus on one particular aspect, such as the evolution of code metrics or architecture. Approaches using a static view with a time axis (such as line charts) are limited in their expressiveness regarding structure, and approaches visualizing structure quickly become cluttered with an increasing number of revisions and components. We propose a novel trade-off between displaying global structure over a large time period with reduced accuracy and visualizing fine-grained changes of individual components with absolute accuracy. We demonstrate how our approach displays changes by blending redundant visual features (such as scales or repeating data points) where they are not expressive. We show how using this approach to explore software evolution can reveal ephemeral information when familiarizing oneself with a new project. We provide a working implementation as an extension to our open-source library for fine-grained evolution analysis, LISA.",software visualization;software evolution visualization;graph;node link diagram
IEEE,conferencePaper,2019,Visualizing Code Genealogy: How Code is Evolutionarily Fixed in Program Repair?,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Automated program repair (in short, APR) techniques that utilize genetic algorithm (in short, GA) have a capability of repairing programs even if the programs require multiple code fragments to be changed. Those techniques repeat program generation, program evaluation, and program selection until a generated program passes all given test cases. Those techniques occasionally generate a large number of programs before a repaired program is generated. Thus, it is difficult to understand how an input program is evolved in the loop processing of genetic algorithm. In this paper, we are inspired by genealogy and propose a new technique to visualize program evolution in the process of automated program repair. We have implemented the proposed technique as a software tool for kGenProg, which is one of GA-based APR tools. We evaluated the proposed technique with the developers of kGenProg. In the evaluation, the developers found latent issues in kGenProg's processing and came up with new ideas to improve program generation. From those results, we conclude that our visualization is useful to understand program evolution in the APR process.",Automated Program Repair;Code Genealogy;Evolution History;Visualization;Genetic Algorithm

IEEE,conferencePaper,2019,A User Study on the Usefulness of Visualization Support for Requirements Monitoring,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Many requirements monitoring approaches have been proposed that check key properties of systems and their interactions at runtime. Some of these approaches also visualize monitoring results and provide details on requirements violations to end users. However, only few studies exist about the usefulness of requirements monitoring tools for practitioners, particularly regarding visualization. In this paper, we present a user study we have conducted with both industrial practitioners and researchers to assess the usefulness of visualization capabilities we have been developing for an event-based requirements monitoring tool. These capabilities allow users to monitor the status of the involved systems, to view trends and statistics, and to inspect the events and data that led to specific violations when diagnosing their root cause. We first performed a walkthrough of the tool using the cognitive dimensions of notations framework from the field of human-computer interaction. We then conducted a user study involving five software engineers of a large company from the automation software domain and four researchers. Using the tool's visualization capabilities all subjects succeeded in monitoring a real-world automation system and in diagnosing violations.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2019,Exploring Eye Tracking Data on Source Code via Dual Space Analysis,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Eye tracking is a frequently used technique to collect data capturing users' strategies and behaviors in processing information. Understanding how programmers navigate through a large number of classes and methods to find bugs is important to educators and practitioners in software engineering. However, the eye tracking data collected on realistic codebases is massive compared to traditional eye tracking data on one static page. The same content may appear in different areas on the screen with users scrolling in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Hierarchically structured content and fluid method position compose the two major challenges for visualization. We present a dual-space analysis approach to explore eye tracking data by leveraging existing software visualizations and a new graph embedding visualization. We use the graph embedding technique to quantify the distance between two arbitrary methods, which offers a more accurate visualization of distance with respect to the inherent relations, compared with the direct software structure and the call graph. The visualization offers both naturalness and readability showing time-varying eye movement data in both the content space and the embedded space, and provides new discoveries in developers' eye tracking behaviors.",visualization;eye tracking;developer classification;content space;embedded space

For interaction with speech (i.e., natural language), we present an architecture and an implementation of conversational interfaces for the Microsoft HoloLens device. We aim to remedy some peculiarities of AR devices, but also enhancing the exploration task at hand. To implement the conversational interface different natural language processing (NLP) components such as natural language generation and intent recognition are typically required. Our proposed architecture integrates conversational components with the AR-based software visualization. We describe its implementation based on different user utterances, where the system provides information about the to-be-explored component-based software architecture in the form of adjusted visualizations and speech-based results. We apply out tool to explore OSGi-based software architectures.",software visualization;augmented reality;conversational interfaces;chatbots;natural language processing;graph databases;osgi;software architecture
IEEE,conferencePaper,2019,CodeHouse: VR Code Visualization Tool,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Derivative software development complicates the base software over the years of enhancement and maintenance. It reduces the source code readability, taking developers a long time to understand the software structure and its various parts. In software engineering, software is often compared to buildings. We propose to use this metaphor from a new prospective to help developers understand the existing software efficiently. In this paper, we present a tool called ""CodeHouse"" that visualizes the source code of the software in a VR space as if it were a house. By placing rooms, which represent modules of the software, on the inside of a virtual cylinder, the CodeHouse makes it possible for the developers to understand both the whole structure of the software and the details of individual program parts before they begin derivative development. The CodeHouse also links with a debugger and helps developers to understand the dynamic behaviors of the program.",virtual reality;software comprehension support;software visualization;visualization metaphor;derivative development
IEEE,conferencePaper,2019,CloneCompass: Visualizations for Exploring Assembly Code Clone Ecosystems,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Assembly code analysis is an intensive process undertaken by security analysts and reverse engineers to discover vulnerabilities in existing software when source code is unavailable. Kam1n0 is an efficient code clone search engine that facilitates assembly code analysis. However, Kam1n0 search results can contain millions of function-clone pairs, and efficiently exploring and comprehensively understanding the resulting data can be challenging. This paper presents a design study whereby we collaborated with analyst stakeholders to identify requirements for a tool that visualizes and scales to millions of function-clone pairs. These requirements led to the design of an interactive visual tool, CloneCompass, consisting of novel TreeMap Matrix and Adjacency Matrix visualizations to aid in the exploration of assembly code clones extracted from Kam1n0. We conducted a preliminary evaluation with the analyst stakeholders and show how CloneCompass enables these users to visually and interactively explore code clone data generated from software systems with suspected vulnerabilities.",visualization;assembly code clone;Kam1n0;matrix-based view;reverse engineering

Systems are restricted by structural and static deficiencies that we can aim to reduce by providing developers with effective visualizations of their code. We developed CorpusVis a widget-based application to explore software metrics of Java software systems from the Qualitas Corpus. Through an evaluation of the visualization techniques we identified what visualizations were effective and which ones did not scale well for large software systems. Our application helps to reduce the structural and static deficiencies in developers code which enables developers to spend less time maintaining legacy systems and learn to develop more effective code for future systems.",

A line of previous works sought to better understand software maintenance by studying how commits can be classified into three main software maintenance activities. Corrective: fault fixing; Perfective: system improvements; Adaptive: new feature introduction. In this work we suggest visualizations for exploring software maintenance activities in both project and individual developer scopes. We demonstrate our approach using a prototype we have built using the Shiny R framework. In addition, we have also published our prototype as an online demo. This demo allows users to explore the maintenance activities of a number of popular open source projects. We believe that the visualizations we provide can assist practitioners in monitoring and maintaining the health of software projects. In particular, they can be useful for identifying general imbalances, peaks, deeps and other anomalies in projects' and developers' maintenance activities.","Software Maintenance, Software Evolution, Predictive Modeling"

IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,RepoVis: Visual Overviews and Full-Text Search in Software Repositories,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Project managers and software developers often have difficulty maintaining an overview of the structure, evolution, and status of collaborative software projects. Some tools are available for typical source code management systems, which provide summary statistics or simple visual representations of merge-branch graphs. However, comprehensive visual overview and search facilities for such repositories are lacking. RepoVis is a new tool which provides comprehensive visual overviews and full-text search for projects maintained in Git repositories. The overview shows folders, files, and lines of code colour-coded according to last modification, developer, file type, or associated issues. Full-text searches can be performed for terms of interest within source code files, commit messages, or any associated metadata or usability findings, with matches displayed visually in the overview. The utility of the RepoVis approach is illustrated with three use cases of real-world software inspection. Insights are presented into the utility of full-text search and visual presentation of matches for program comprehension.","software visualisation, program comprehension, usability, metrics, visual overview, full-text search, git repositories."
IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,Detecting Bad Smells in Software Systems with Linked Multivariate Visualizations,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Parallel coordinates plots and RadViz are two visualization techniques that deal with multivariate data. They complement each other in identifying data patterns, clusters, and outliers. In this paper, we analyze multivariate software metrics linking the two approaches for detecting outliers, which could be the indicators for bad smells in software systems. Parallel coordinates plots provide an overview, whereas the RadViz representation allows for comparing a smaller subset of metrics in detail. We develop an interactive visual analytics system supporting automatic detection of bad smell patterns. In addition, we investigate the distinctive properties of outliers that are not considered harmful, but noteworthy for other reasons. We demonstrate our approach with open source Java systems and describe detected bad smells and other outlier patterns.",Bad smells;Software metrics;Multivariate visualization
IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,A Controlled Experiment on Spatial Orientation in VR-Based Software Cities,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Multiple authors have proposed a city metaphor for visualizing software. While early approaches have used three-dimensional rendering on standard two-dimensional displays, recently researchers have started to use head-mounted displays to visualize software cities in immersive virtual reality systems (IVRS). For IVRS of a higher order it is claimed that they offer a higher degree of engagement and immersion as well as more intuitive interaction. On the other hand, spatial orientation may be a challenge in IVRS as already reported by studies on the use of IVRS in domains outside of software engineering such as gaming, education, training, and mechanical engineering or maintenance tasks. This might be even more true for the city metaphor for visualizing software. Software is immaterial and, hence, has no natural appearance. Only a limited number of abstract aspects of software are mapped onto visual representations so that software cities generally lack the details of the real world, such as the rich variety of objects or fine textures, which are often used as clues for orientation in the real world. In this paper, we report on an experiment in which we compare navigation in a particular kind of software city (EvoStreets) in two variants of IVRS. One with head-mounted display and hand controllers versus a 3D desktop visualization on a standard display with keyboard and mouse interaction involving 20 participants.",Visualization;Software City;Orientation;Experiment;Software Engineering;Virtual Reality
IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,Visualization Tool for Designing Microservices with the Monolith-First Approach,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"The microservice architecture is essential for agile development and deployment of the application components; however, designing microservices for a web application is not a straight-forward task. One of the best ways to design microservices is to decompose a monolithic prototype of an application into microservices on the basis of both the complexity in engineering and the component boundaries of the application in the early phase of development. We propose a visualization tool allowing developers to interactively design microservice applications on the basis of the characteristics of source codes and the behaviors of a monolithic prototype. This visualization tool first constructs a calling-context tree from profile data taken in a dry-run of the application. Next, it generates an initial microservice design while considering keyword features in the source codes or amount of function calls between components. Developers can interactively refine this design via this visual interface by taking four-choice actions to revise boundaries of microservices while considering expected communications between them. This interaction will have a significant impact on runtime performance. Case studies of two open-source benchmark applications demonstrate the proposed tool enables interactive design of microservices. The results of the demonstration show that compared to the official microservice designs of the applications, the proposed tool can effectively design microservice applications.",Software visualization;microservices;monolithic application;calling context;call graph
IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,Effective Visualization of Object Allocation Sites,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Profiling the memory consumption of a software execution is usually carried out by characterizing calling-context trees. However, the plurality nature of this data-structure makes it difficult to adequately and efficiently exploit in practice. As a consequence, most of anomalies in memory footprints are addressed either manually or in an ad-hoc way. We propose an interactive visualization of the execution context related to object productions. Our visualization augments the traditional calling-context tree with visual cues to characterize object allocation sites.We performed a qualitative study involving eight software engineers conducting a software execution memory assessment. As a result, we found that participants find our visualization as beneficial to characterizing a memory consumption and to reducing the overall memory footprint.",Profiling;visualization;memory-consumption

IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,Quality Models Inside Out: Interactive Visualization of Software Metrics by Means of Joint Probabilities,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Assessing software quality, in general, is hard; each metric has a different interpretation, scale, range of values, or measurement method. Combining these metrics automatically is especially difficult, because they measure different aspects of software quality, and creating a single global final quality score limits the evaluation of the specific quality aspects and trade-offs that exist when looking at different metrics. We present a way to visualize multiple aspects of software quality. In general, software quality can be decomposed hierarchically into characteristics, which can be assessed by various direct and indirect metrics. These characteristics are then combined and aggregated to assess the quality of the software system as a whole. We introduce an approach for quality assessment based on joint distributions of metrics values. Visualizations of these distributions allow users to explore and compare the quality metrics of software systems and their artifacts, and to detect patterns, correlations, and anomalies. Furthermore, it is possible to identify common properties and flaws, as our visualization approach provides rich interactions for visual queries to the quality models' multivariate data. We evaluate our approach in two use cases based on: 30 real-world technical documentation projects with 20,000 XML documents, and an open source project written in Java with 1000 classes. Our results show that the proposed approach allows an analyst to detect possible causes of bad or good quality.",hierarchical data exploration;multivariate data visualization;joint probabilities;t-SNE;data abstraction

In our work, we address this research gap by the design and evaluation of three interactive visualizations which combine the data from the version control (VCS), the issue tracking (ITS), and the continuous integration (CI) system. After analyzing the information needs of a project team and describing the available data, we selected change impact, code ownership, and activity peaks as our visualization topics. Then, we adapted suitable visualization techniques from the literature to meet our design requirements. After implementation, we evaluated our visualizations by conducting a usability test with ten senior software engineers. On the system usability scale (SUS), our visualizations achieved the rating ""good"" from the participants. A scenario success rate of 88% and the qualitative user feedback has provided evidence for the benefits of visualizing combined data from the VCS, ITS, and CI system.",Data visualization;Data mining;Software engineering;Mining software repositories
IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,Simultaneous Visual Analysis of Multiple Software Hierarchies,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"We propose a tree visualization technique for comparison of structures and attributes across multiple hierarchies. Many software systems are structured hierarchically by design. For example, developers subdivide source code into libraries, modules, and functions. This design propagates to software configuration and business processes, rendering software hierarchies even more important. Often these structural elements are attributed with reference counts, code quality metrics, and the like. Throughout the entire software life cycle, these hierarchies are reviewed, integrated, debugged, and changed many times by different people so that the identity of a structural element and its attributes is not clearly traceable. We argue that pairwise comparison of similar trees is a tedious task due to the lack of overview, especially when applied to a large number of hierarchies. Therefore, we strive to visualize multiple similar trees as a whole by merging them into one supertree. To merge structures and combine attributes from different trees, we leverage the Jaccard similarity and solve a matching problem while keeping track of the origin of a structure element and its attributes. Our visualization approach allows users to inspect these supertrees using node-link diagrams and indented tree plots. The nodes in these plots depict aggregated attributes and, using word-sized line plots, detailed data. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method by exploring the evolution of software repositories and debugging data processing pipelines using provenance data.",Hierarchy comparison;hierarchy visualization;software evolution;data provenance

While quality criteria (and algorithms that optimize for them) are known for static trees, far less has been studied for treemapping dynamic trees. We address this gap by proposing a methodology and associated quality metrics to measure the quality of dynamic treemaps for the specific use-case and context of software evolution visualization. We apply our methodology on a benchmark containing a wide range of real-world software repositories and 12 well-known treemap algorithms. Based on our findings, we discuss the observed advantages and limitations of various treemapping algorithms for visualizing software structure evolution, and propose ways for users to choose the most suitable treemap algorithm based on the targeted criteria of interest.",Treemap;Stability;Evaluation

However, there are various sources of data about a software system. The methods used to extract the relevant data are as diverse as the sources are.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,Scoped: Evaluating A Composite Visualisation of the Scope Chain Hierarchy Within Source Code,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"This paper presents two studies that evaluate the effectiveness of a software visualisation tool which uses a com-posite visualisation to encode the scope chain and information related to the scope chain within source code. The first study evaluates the effectiveness of adding the composite visualisation to a source code editor to help programmers understand scope relationships within source code. The second study evaluates the effectiveness of each individual component within the composite visualisation. The composite visualisation is composed of a packed circle tree diagram (overview component) and a list view (detail view component). The packed circle tree functions as an abstract mini-map to provide viewers with a high-level overview of the scope chain hierarchy within a source code document. The list view provides additional information about identifiers (variables, functions, and parameters) that are accessible from the scope within which the cursor is located, in the source code document. Both studies utilise a between-subject design, in which groups of participants were presented with source code fragments and asked to answer a series of code understanding questions. The results of the studies indicate that adding a composite visualisation to a source code editor can have a positive effect on code understanding, especially when the textual representation of the code no longer corresponds to the actual behaviour of the code (as is the case, for example, in languages such as JavaScript that implement variable hoisting).",software visualisation;source code visualistion;empirical evaluation

It has been observed that this process often leads to the erosion of the systems design and architecture and with it, the decline of many desirable quality attributes, such as maintainability. This process can be captured in terms of antipatterns - atomic violations of widely accepted design principles. We present a visualisation that exposes the design of evolving Java programs, highlighting instances of selected antipatterns including their emergence and cancerous growth. This visualisation assists software engineers and architects in assessing, tracing and therefore combating design erosion.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,The Code Mini-Map Visualisation: Encoding Conceptual Structures Within Source Code,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Modern source code editors typically include a code mini-map visualisation, which provides programmers with an overview of the currently open source code document. This paper proposes to add a layering mechanism to the code mini-map visualisation in order to provide programmers with visual answers to questions related to conceptual structures that are not manifested directly in the code. Details regarding the design and implementation of this scope information layer, which displays additional encodings that correspond to the scope chain and information related to the scope chain within a source code document, is presented. The scope information layer can be used by programmers to answer questions such as: to which scope does a specific variable belong, and in which scope is the cursor of the source code editor currently located in. Additionally, this paper presents a study that evaluates the effectiveness of adding the scope information layer to a code mini-map visualisation in order to help programmers understand scope relationships within source code.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,Towards Viewpoint-driven Visual Analysis for Effective Architecture Recovery,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"In the context of software architecture recovery, visual representations can allow architects or developers to perceive and comprehend the recovered information faster. Many visualizations address various facets of the complex information space, but there are no systematic approaches for the architect to efficiently evaluate candidate visualizations for suitability, or to explore ways to extend them. The resultant ad-hoc selection from available generic visualizations leads to ineffective comprehension and analysis. We propose a viewpoint-driven approach towards tackling this problem. From a comparison of the conceptual models of architectural viewpoints and information visualization, we observe that focusing on the concerns framed by a viewpoint can guide the suitable selection of visualization tasks. The viewpoint description also serves a source for the definition of the visualization dataset. Starting from a seed visualization, a simple measure called the task/concern coverage allows the architecture visualization designer to decide if the resulting visualization can express all the desired concerns. This approach is illustrated with an example of the Polyptychon hierarchical dependencies visualization.",software-architecture-recovery;software-visualization;architecture-viewpoints

These support an in-depth analysis of the program behavior, each approach focusing on a different aspect. What is missing, however, is an approach to get an overview of a program execution. As a first step to fill this gap, this paper presents an approach to generate Method Execution Reports. Each report summarizes the execution of a selected method for a specific execution of the program using natural-language text and embedded visualizations. A report provides an overview of the dynamic calls and time consumption related to the selected method.

Although multiple media can be used to display a visualization, the standard computer screen is used the most. We hypothesize that the medium has a role in their effectiveness. We investigate our hypotheses by conducting a controlled user experiment. In the experiment we focus on the 3D city visualization technique used for software comprehension tasks. We deploy 3D city visualizations across a standard computer screen (SCS), an immersive 3D environment (I3D), and a physical 3D printed model (P3D). We asked twenty-seven participants (whom we divided in three groups for each medium) to visualize software systems of various sizes, solve a set of uniform comprehension tasks, and complete a questionnaire. We measured the effectiveness of visualizations in terms of performance, recollection, and user experience. We found that even though developers using P3D required the least time to identify outliers, they perceived the least difficulty when visualizing systems based on SCS. Moreover, developers using I3D obtained the highest recollection.",software visualization;3D visualization;controlled experiment;virtual reality;3D printed models
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,iTraceVis: Visualizing Eye Movement Data Within Eclipse,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"The paper presents iTraceVis, an eye tracking visualization component for iTrace, a gaze-aware Eclipse plugin. The visualization component is designed to work with data generated from iTrace after an eye tracking session. iTrace provides us with an automatic mapping of raw eye gaze on corresponding source code elements according to their hierarchy in the abstract syntax graph even in the presence of scrolling and context switching between files. This feature provides us with the ability to visualize eye tracking data in large source code files and is not just restricted to visualize only a method at a time i.e., something that fits on the screen. Due to the enormous size and richness of data collected from the eye tracker, visualizations help both the researcher and the developer to comprehend what transpired during an eye tracking session. iTraceVis currently supports four visualization views - heat map, gaze skyline, static gaze map, and dynamic gaze map. In order to determine the usefulness of the visualizations, we conduct a pilot user study with 10 senior students. We present an existing eye-tracking developer session to the study participants and ask them a series of questions while they interacted with iTraceVis and its various views in Eclipse. The results indicate that the visualizations do indeed help users understand the visualized session represented by the data, and also provide insight into where the visualizations can be improved as part of future work.",eye-movement visualization;Eclipse;heat map;gaze plot;synchronized views
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,Using High-Rising Cities to Visualize Performance in Real-Time,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"For developers concerned with a performance drop or improvement in their software, a profiler allows a developer to quickly search and identify bottlenecks and leaks that consume much execution time. Non real-time profilers analyze the history of already executed stack traces, while a real-time profiler outputs the results concurrently with the execution of software, so users can know the results instantaneously. However, a real-time profiler risks providing overly large and complex outputs, which is difficult for developers to quickly analyze. In this paper, we visualize the performance data from a real-time profiler. We visualize program execution as a three-dimensional (3D) city, representing the structure of the program as artifacts in a city (i.e., classes and packages expressed as buildings and districts) and their program executions expressed as the fluctuating height of artifacts. Through two case studies and using a prototype of our proposed visualization, we demonstrate how our visualization can easily identify performance issues such as a memory leak and compare performance changes between versions of a program.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,Visual Exploration of Memory Traces and Call Stacks,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Analysis of software performance typically takes into account clock cycles and memory consumption at each sampling point in time. Although this is a valid strategy, we argue that it is also worth investigating data and control flow structures, as observed using memory traces and call stacks, because of their importance for performance engineering. In this work, we present a visual approach to memory profiling that supports analysis of memory layout, access patterns, and aliasing in correlation to program execution. Our method leverages language-agnostic dynamic code instrumentation to minimize the impact of tracing on performance, i.e., the application remains usable on commodity hardware. The profiled data is then clustered and visualized using a density-based scatter plot. If debug symbols are available, the scatter plot is augmented by a flame graph to ease linking to the high-level source code. Our visualization helps software engineers to identify runtime behavior by relating memory addresses to instruction execution. We demonstrate our approach using a set of examples revealing different memory access patterns and discuss their influence on software performance.",

In this paper, we present an approach to help with the second type of skill. There are tools that explain/visualize the execution by stepping through the code. However, such tools suffer from two types of problems. First, the granularity of the stepping is coarse, hiding the intermediate steps in evaluating expressions. Second, for a single statement corresponding to a step of the execution, the order of the evaluation of source code constructs is not aligned with the order the constructs appear in the source code. To fix those, we combine compile-time with run-time information to automatically produce intuitive explanations of code. At compile time, we generate the explanations by traversing the AST. The runtime information provides the execution map and runtime values. We applied our idea to the Java version of Online Python Tutor, a web-based program visualization tool. Each explanation is complemented by highlighting the piece of the source code to which it corresponds, being spoken by the system, and a tree structure visualizing the evaluation of the involved expressions. The fact that the generation of explanations is syntax driven makes the result close to what a human tutor would provide.",Virtual tutor;Abstract syntax tree;Expression evaluation;Concept-level evaluation;Visualization
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,An Empirical Study on the Readability of Regular Expressions: Textual Versus Graphical,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Although the readability of source code plays an important role in software construction, not many studies are available that do actually compare the impact of different notations on the readability of source code. Among the huge set of possible languages to be studied, one language is frequently used in education as well as in practice: regular expressions. This paper introduces a randomized controlled trial performed on 22 participants that compares two different notations for regular expressions: a textual and a graphical one. It shows that a regular expression's length as well as the notation (textual vs. graphical) has a strong effect on the regular expression's readability while the participants' background showed no measurable effect. On average, the time required by the participants to answer questions about shortest words using the textual representation was almost three times higher than the time it took for answering such questions using the graphical representation.",Regular Expressions;Visualization;Controlled Experiment;Empirical Study
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,A Scalable Visualization for Dynamic Data in Software System Hierarchies,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Software systems can grow large, consisting of thousands of hierarchically organized elements like directories, subdirectories, files, and functions. Moreover, those hierarchy elements can carry additional information worth investigating for a software developer. Getting an overview of both the hierarchy and the attached static or dynamic data can become a tedious task if it is not supported by a visually scalable visualization technique. In this paper, we use a hierarchy visualization based on the visual metaphor of indentation to generate an overview of the software system hierarchy and easily attach additional attributes. The extra information is aligned with the hierarchy elements and, hence, supports visual comparisons of the attachments on different levels of hierarchical granularity. Through interaction, we provide additional views on the data, e.g., by filtering, hierarchy transformations, or details-on-demand. We illustrate the usefulness of our hierarchy visualization technique by means of an application example exploring data from the open-source software project jEdit. We investigated the readability of the hierarchy visualization with a user experiment, comparing indentation to node-link diagrams for varying sizes of a hierarchy.",graph visualization;software visualization
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,Round-Trip Sketches: Supporting the Lifecycle of Software Development Sketches from Analog to Digital and Back,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Sketching is an important activity for understanding, designing, and communicating different aspects of software systems such as their requirements or architecture. Often, sketches start on paper or whiteboards, are revised, and may evolve into a digital version. Users may then print a revised sketch, change it on paper, and digitize it again. Existing tools focus on a paperless workflow, i.e., archiving analog documents, or rely on special hardware-they do not focus on integrating digital versions into the analog-focused workflow that many users follow. In this paper, we present the conceptual design and a prototype of LivelySketches, a tool that supports the ""round-trip"" lifecycle of sketches from analog to digital and back. The proposed workflow includes capturing both analog and digital sketches as well as relevant context information. In addition, users can link sketches to other related sketches or documents. They may access the linked artifacts and captured information using digital as well as augmented analog versions of the sketches. We further present results from a formative user study with four students and outline possible directions for future work.",sketches;diagrams;software development;document management

IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,Towards the Visualization of Usage and Decision Knowledge in Continuous Software Engineering,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Continuous software engineering (CSE) includes activities to continuously evolve software artifacts. Along with these activities, developers employ knowledge such as usage and decision knowledge. Usage knowledge helps developers to understand how users apply software, while decision knowledge comprises all decisions taken during CSE and their rationale. However, due to the frequency, extent, and complexity of knowledge in CSE environments, accessing and processing knowledge is challenging for developers. We propose a dashboard for developers that visualizes knowledge from various sources. This enables developers to follow, reflect, interact, and react on knowledge in CSE environments. We introduce springboards that serve as knowledge selectors while the selected extract of knowledge is visualized in widgets. Widgets allow developers to gain insight into knowledge. We suggest three widget classes: spot, compare, and range. We discuss dashboard extensions such as interaction triggers to add, modify, or combine knowledge. We plan to implement the dashboard and evaluate it with teams during software development projects in an industrial setting.",Continuous Software Engineering;Knowledge Visualization;Usage Knowledge;Decision Knowledge;Dashboard;Springboard;Widget

IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,"GETAVIZ: Generating Structural, Behavioral, and Evolutionary Views of Software Systems for Empirical Evaluation",VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Software visualizations are used to support stakeholders in software engineering activities like development, project management, and maintenance. The respective tasks determine which aspects of software, i.e., structural, behavioral and/or evolutionary information, need to be visualized. To promote the usage of software visualizations they have to optimally support the needs of the respective stakeholder for the specific task at hand. Therefore, we see the necessity to create innovative visualizations and to optimize existing ones. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to empirically evaluate the different visualizations and their variants. In this paper, we present GETAVIZ as a toolset to support these processes, i.e., designing visualizations, generating task- and role specific visualizations, and conducting empirical evaluations. The toolset implements the concept of generative and model-driven software visualization and makes it possible to generate different visualizations for all three aspects of software. Its strength lies in its adaptability, so that new visualizations and variations of existing ones can be implemented easily. In addition to the generator this toolset contains several extractors for different programming languages, a browser-based user interface for viewing and interacting with visualizations, and an evaluation server to facilitate the execution of local and remote experiments. The paper illustrates the capabilities of GETAVIZ and it discusses plans for its further development.",3.0;evaluation process;empirical evaluation;software visualization;user interface;visualization metaphor

For systems based on the OSGi component specification, which are used to build quite large applications with back-end and front-end services, tools for visualizing the actual architecture can help to understand the system. We provide an interactive tool that visualizes OSGi-based systems with their components, packages, services, and dependencies in 3D using Virtual Reality headsets. It uses the metaphor of modular electronic systems. The tool allows software engineers, project managers, or clients to explore the architecture and get a first impression about component sizes and their dependencies.",software visualization;virtual reality

Trying to say the most with the fewest words. In contrast, the athenizer is a tool that expands the code, placing it in a more maintainable form, using plenty of auxiliary variables, many potential locations for breakpoints and for change.The tool reported on here allows developers to interactively use their joystick and its buttons for code navigation, and in particular for zooming-in into the code (athenizing) and zooming-out of it (spartanizing).",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,SoL Mantra: Visualizing Update Opportunities Based on Library Coexistence,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"In software development, software reuse has become a pivotal factor in creating and providing high-quality software at a reduced cost. The reuse of a code creates dependencies, which as they increase over time become difficult to manage and avoid compatibility issues or bugs. With newer version releases, come various quality improvements, new features and issue fixes, but deciding whether or not to adopt those is a difficult task for large software with a lot of dependencies. To address those difficulties, we propose SoL Mantra which is a tool that shows update opportunities by leveraging the Wisdom of the Crowd in a software ecosystem. Using this combined knowledge, our tool displays information about the complexity of each update opportunity. The orbital layout provides the means to visualize the update opportunities and demonstrate its merits by showcasing two examples from the JavaScript ecosystem. Through these examples, we demonstrate how maintainers can benefit from SoL Mantra's visual cues.",Library Dependency;Coexistence;Orbital Layout

IEEE,conferencePaper,2016,Merge-Tree: Visualizing the Integration of Commits into Linux,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"With an average of more than 900 top-level merges into the Linux kernel per release, many containing hundreds of commits and some containing thousands, maintenance of older versions of the kernel becomes nearly impossible. Various commercial products, such as the Android platform, run older versions of the kernel. Due to security, performance, and changing hardware needs, maintainers must understand what changes (commits) are added to the current version of the kernel since the last time they inspected it in order to make the necessary patches. Current tools provide information about repositories through the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the repository, which is helpful for smaller projects. However, with the scale and number of branches in the kernel the DAG becomes overwhelming very quickly. Furthermore, the DAG contains every ancestor of every commit, while maintainers are more interested in how and when a commit arrives to the official Linux repository. In this paper, we propose the merge-tree, a simplified transformation of the DAG of the Linux git repository that shows the way in which commits are merged into the master branch of Linux. Using the merge-tree, we build Linvis, a tool that is designed to allow users to explore how commits are merged into the Linux kernel.",Linux;git;data structures;tree data structures
IEEE,conferencePaper,2016,Visualizing Project Evolution through Abstract Syntax Tree Analysis,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"What is a developer's contribution to a repository? By only counting commits and number of lines changed, existing tools that visualize source code repositories (such as GitHub's graphs) fall short on showing the effective contributions made by each developer. When many commits are viewed as a group, the details are lost. Commit information can be misleading since lines of code give no indication of what was actually being worked on without careful examination of the changed code. Providing a semantic view of this information could provide deeper insights into how software projects evolve since changes to design and features are not clearly visible from line changes alone. We present TypeV: a method for visualizing Java source code repositories. Instead of counting line changes in a commit we extract detailed type information over time by using the differences between abstract syntax trees (ASTs). We are then able to track the additions and deletions of declarations and invocations for each type. Furthermore, we can track each author's type usage over time. Using TypeV, we examine specific cases in well-known repositories where our tool reveals interesting and useful information. We then compare type coverage information from the AST compared to file coverage to determine if unique information is provided by type information.",

A mutation occurs whenever a value is assigned to an object field. Analyzing the evolution of object mutation is known to be difficult. Unfortunately, classical code debuggers painfully support the analysis of object mutations. Object Evolution Blueprint is a visualization dedicated to exploring object mutation over time. Our blueprint visually and concisely represents sequences of field mutations. The history of each field is adequately shown with respect to the dynamic value types. We have observed the use of our blueprint with three practitioners. Our visualization has been well received and accepted to complete two different software comprehension tasks.

Typical SPLs involve large number of features which are combined to form also large numbers of products, implemented using multiple and different types of software artifacts. Because of the sheer amount of information and its complexity visualization techniques have been used at different stages of the life cycle of SPLs. In this paper we present a systematic mapping study on this subject.

Understanding the machine can be easier when it is represented graphically, and tools have been developed to this end. However, these tools typically support only one programming language and do not work in a web browser. In this article, we present the functionality and technical implementation of the two visualization tools. First, the language-agnostic and extensible Jsvee library helps educators visualize notional machines and create expression-level program animations for online course materials. Second, the Kelmu toolkit can be used by ebook authors to augment automatically generated animations, for instance by adding annotations such as textual explanations and arrows.

To effectively evolve and maintain SPLs it is vital to understand how features are implemented and how they interact at different levels from source code to runtime. However the large number of features and the complex nature of interactions in typical SPLs make maintenance and evolution tasks challenging, and demand robust tool support for the software engineers to carry out these tasks. In this paper we present the first results of our ongoing work to address this need.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2016,Towards Actionable Visualisation in Software Development,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Although abundant studies have shown how visualisation can help software developers to perform their daily tasks, visualisation is still not a common practice since developers have little support for adopting a proper visualisation for their needs. In this paper we review the 346 papers published in SOFTVIS/VISSOFT venues and identify 65 design study papers that describe how visualisation is used to alleviate various difficulties in software development. We classify these studies into several problem domains that we collected from the research on software development community, and highlight the characteristics of each study. On the one hand, we support software developers to put visualisation in action by mapping existing techniques to particular needs in various problem domains. On the other hand, we help researchers in the field by exposing domains with little visualisation support. We found a disconnect between the problem domains on which visualisation have focused and the domains that get the most attention from practitioners.",

However, data-intensive applications nowadays tend to access their underlying database in an increasingly dynamic way. The queries that they send to the database server are usually built at runtime, through String concatenation, or Object-Relational-Mapping (ORM) frameworks. This level of dynamicity significantly complicates the task of adapting programs to an evolving database schema.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2016,A Visualization Framework for Parallelization,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Since the advent of multicore processors, developers struggle with the parallelization of legacy software. Automatic methods are only appropriate to identify parallelism at instruction level or within simple loops. For most applications, however, a scalable redesign require profound comprehension of the underlying software architecture and its dynamic aspects. This leads to an increasing demand for interactive tools that foster parallelization at various granularity levels. To cope with this problem, we propose a visualization framework, and three tailored views for parallelism detection. The framework is part of Parceive, a tool that utilizes dynamic binary instrumentation to trace C/C++ and C# programs. The cooperative views allow identification and analysis of potential parallelism scenarios using seamless navigation, abstraction, and filtering. In this paper, we motivate our approach, illustrate the architecture of the visualization framework, and highlight the key features of the views.

Basic aspects of a software architecture are the modules the software is constructed of and the dependencies between them. To comprehend these aspects is important especially for software using a technology such as OSGi, which key concept is modularization. In this paper, we describe interactive visualization tools that we developed to comprehend large OSGi-based applications with their modules and dependencies.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2016,vizSlice: Visualizing Large Scale Software Slices,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Program slicing has long been used to facilitate program understanding. Several approaches have been suggested for computing slices based on different perspectives, including forward slicing, backward slicing, static slicing, and dynamic slicing. The applications of slicing are numerous, including testing, effort estimation, and impact analysis. Surprisingly, given the maturity of slicing, few approaches exist for visualizing slices. In this paper, we present our tool for visualizing large systems based on program slicing and through two visualization idioms: treemaps and bipartite graphs. In particular, we use treemaps to facilitate slicing-based navigation, and we use bipartite graphs to facilitate visual impact analysis by displaying relationships among system decomposition slices showing the relevant computations involving a given slicing variable. We believe our tool will support various software maintenance tasks, including providing analysts an interactive visualization of the impact of potential changes, thus allowing them to plan maintenance accordingly. Finally, we show that, through the use of both existing scalable slicing and scalable visualization approaches, our tool can facilitate analysis of large software systems.",

Regular debuggers and special graphics debuggers primarily focus on displaying data but do not show how data is transferred from CPU to GPU. If there is an error in data transfer, programmers usually need to locate the error by reading the source code, which many of our students find difficult. We have developed a tool to visualize data flow between CPU and GPU in a 3D pipeline. The visualization helps students understand 3D graphics programs, especially some of the implicit data connections in 3D graphics APIs. It also helps students quickly locate bugs related to data transfer in a 3D pipeline.

They can automatically analyze software and assign quality grades to its components. To provide a meaningful evaluation of quality, rules have to stay up-to-date with the continuously evolving system that they describe. However one would encounter unexpected anomalies during a historical overview because the notion of quality is always changing, while the qualitative evolution analysis requires it to remain constant. To understand the anomalies in a quality history of a real-world software system we use an immersive visualization that lays out the quality fluctuations in three dimensions based on two co-evolving properties: quality rules and source code. This helps us to identify and separate the impact caused by the changes of each property, and allows us to detect significant mistakes that happened during the development process.",software quality;software evolution;visualization;3dimensional;space-time cube;3d matrix

Most profilers do not explain or show why different control paths within a method executed may have resulted in variable execution times. When debugging concurrent programs for performance problems, the complexity and variability in execution time can potentially be even greater. In this paper we take a first step in visualizing individual method's different execution paths within multithreaded Java programs. We restrict our domain to looking at critical sections for this initial analysis, as variability in critical sections may cause more noticeable performance variation. Our software visualization tool, Critical Section Investigator (CSI), builds on the visualization and interaction techniques in previous works like KCachegrind with several enhancements. The result of our work is the first tool to our knowledge that visually shows potential performance differences in synchronized methods in Java programs using a profiling and storytelling structure.",Java;Critical Sections;Concurrency;Program Comprehension;Software Visualization
IEEE,conferencePaper,2016,Visualizing the Evolution of Working Sets,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"As part of their daily work, developers interact with Integrated Development Environments (IDE), generating thousands of events. Together with other aspects of development, this data also captures the modus operandi of the developer, including all the program entities she interacted with during a development session. This ""working set"" (or context) is leveraged by developers to create and maintain their mental model of the software system at hand. Understanding how developers navigate and interact with source code during a development session is an open question. We present a novel visual approach to understand how working sets evolve during a development session. The visualization incrementally depicts all the program entities involved in a development session, the intensity of the developer activity on them, and the navigation paths that occurred between them. We visualized about a thousand development sessions, and categorized them according to their visual properties.",working set;interaction data;ide;dflow;mental model;visual;visualization;development session
IEEE,conferencePaper,2016,MetaVis: Exploring Actionable Visualization,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Software visualization can be very useful for answering complex questions that arise in the software development process. Although modern visualization engines offer expressive APIs for building such visualizations, developers often have difficulties to (1) identify a suitable visualization technique to answer their particular development question, and to (2) implement that visualization using the existing APIs. Examples that illustrate the usage of an engine to build concrete visualizations offer a good starting point, but developers may have to traverse long lists of categories and analyze examples one-by-one to find a suitable one. We propose MetaVis, a tool that fills the gap between existing visualization techniques and their practical applications during software development. We classify questions frequently formulated by software developers and for each, based on our expertise, identify suitable visualizations. MetaVis uses tags mined from these questions to offer a tag-iconic cloud-based visualization. Each tag links to suitable visualizations that developers can explore, modify and try out. We present initial results of an implementation of MetaVis in the Pharo programming environment. The tool visualizes 76 developers' questions assigned to 49 visualization examples.",software visualization;recommendation systems;user needs

VISSOFT is the premier conference on software visualization and related theory and practices in software comprehension. VISSOFT 2015 has taken place in Bremen, Germany. This conference is the third in line after the recent merger of the ACM Symposium on Software Visualization and the IEEE International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis (VISSOFT). VISSOFT 2015 focuses specifically on visualization techniques that draw on aspects of software maintenance, software evolution, program comprehension, reverse engineering and reengineering. As was the case for the first edition of VISSOFT, we are co-located with the 31th International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME).",

Typical artifacts are software, data sets, or detailed experimental descriptions. To reward the effort of creating artifacts, authors of accepted research papers may, if they wish, have their tools, data, or models evaluated by the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC).

We all know that. Then why are our development tools showing mainly text with so much obstinacy? Even when visualizations do make it into our tools, they typically do not make it past the periphery. Something is deeply wrong. We argue that visualizations must become pervasive in software development, and to accommodate this goal, the integrated development environments must change significantly.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Stable Voronoi-based visualizations for software quality monitoring,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Voronoi treemaps can be used to effectively visualize software quality attributes of a given software system. To easily keep track of how the values of such attributes change over time as the software evolves from one version to the next, it is essential that the produced visualizations are stable in the sense that small changes to the values of the attributes lead to small changes in the visualization. Due to the non-deterministic nature of the standard algorithm for computing Voronoi treemaps, stability is not guaranteed. In this paper we introduce stable Voronoi treemaps for additively weighted power Voronoi diagrams. We employ scaled Hilbert curves to place Voronoi sites in the plane, thereby achieving a predictable first good approximation of the final location of the sites, and then retain the order in which sites are placed along that curve for easy comparison with revisions of the same software system. We show that our algorithm not only provides more stability, but also that because of better placement it needs fewer iterations to compute its result.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Visual analytics of software structure and metrics,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"In terms of software maintenance and comprehension, the fields of software engineering and software visualization have produced several methods and tools. However, they are typically separate tools in practice. In this paper, we present a novel methodology of combining software analysis and software visualization tools via an interactive visual workflow modeling approach. Standard software analysis tools are also limited in that they support only well-known metrics or are too complicated to use for generating custom software metrics. To address these shortcomings, our approach focuses on visual elements, their configurations, and interconnectivity rather than a data ontology and querying language. In order to test and validate our methodology, we developed a prototype tool called VIMETRIK (Visual Specification of Metrics). Our preliminary evaluation study illustrates the intuitiveness and ease-of-use of our approach with regard to understanding software measurement and analysis data.",Visual Analytics;Visual Queries;Software Measurement;Software Comprehension;Software Maintenance
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Vestige: A visualization framework for engineering geometry-related software,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Geometry-related software is increasingly important in computational science and visual computing. Engineering such software is particularly challenging due to the size and complexity of the data it operates on. In this paper we present VESTIGE, a framework that employs visualization to address that challenge. VESTIGE targets four software engineering activities: (1) visualization-guided development, (2) monitoring and bug detection, (3) test oracle generation, and (4) debugging. We present five scenarios from our real-life experience as developers of geometry-related software that show how VESTIGE helps to improve the software development process. Integrating VESTIGE into the development workflow takes little effort and can have significant benefits.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Hierarchical software landscape visualization for system comprehension: A controlled experiment,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"In many enterprises the number of deployed applications is constantly increasing. Those applications - often several hundreds - form large software landscapes. The comprehension of such landscapes is frequently impeded due to, for instance, architectural erosion, personnel turnover, or changing requirements. Therefore, an efficient and effective way to comprehend such software landscapes is required. The current state of the art often visualizes software landscapes via flat graph-based representations of nodes, applications, and their communication. In our ExplorViz visualization, we introduce hierarchical abstractions aiming at solving typical system comprehension tasks fast and accurately for large software landscapes. To evaluate our hierarchical approach, we conduct a controlled experiment comparing our hierarchical landscape visualization to a flat, state-of-the-art visualization. In addition, we thoroughly analyze the strategies employed by the participants and provide a package containing all our experimental data to facilitate the verifiability, reproducibility, and further extensibility of our results. We observed a statistically significant increase of 14 % in task correctness of the hierarchical visualization group compared to the flat visualization group in our experiment. The time spent on the system comprehension tasks did not show any significant differences. The results backup our claim that our hierarchical concept enhances the current state of the art in landscape visualization.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,A survey on goal-oriented visualization of clone data,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Comprehending software clones is necessary for a number of activities in software development. The comprehension of software clones is challenged by the sheer volume of data and the complexity of the information content in that data. Visualization, or visual data analysis, takes advantage of human cognitive skills to discover unstructured insights from the visual presentations of complex and voluminous data. In this paper, we survey the existing literature on visualization of software clones. We gather the insights provided, and put that information in context of actual information needs systematically derived from the clone management goals. This framework allows us to better understand the role a visualization may play in achieving a specific user goal, identify potential gaps between existing types of visualization and information needs, and find complementary non-redundant subsets of visualizations for each user goal.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Interactive tag cloud visualization of software version control repositories,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Version control repositories contain a wealth of implicit information that can be used to answer many questions about a project's development process. However, this information is not directly accessible in the version control archives and must be extracted and visualized. This paper describes ConceptCloud, a flexible, interactive browser for SVN and Git repositories. The main novelty of our approach is the combination of an intuitive tag cloud visualization with an underlying concept lattice that provides a formal structure for navigation. ConceptCloud supports concurrent navigation in multiple linked but individually customizable tag clouds, which allows for multi-faceted repository browsing and for the construction of unique visualizations. We describe the mathematical foundations and implementation of our approach, and use ConceptCloud to quickly gain insight into the team structure and development process of two projects.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Visualising software as a particle system,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Current metrics-based approaches to visualise unfamiliar software systems face two key limitations: (1) They are limited in terms of the number of dimensions that can be projected, and (2) they use fixed layout algorithms where the resulting positions of entities can be vulnerable to mis-interpretation. In this paper we show how computer games technology can be used to address these problems. We present the PhysVis software exploration system, where software metrics can be variably mapped to parameters of a physical model and displayed via a particle system. Entities can be imbued with attributes such as mass, gravity, and (for relationships) strength or springiness, alongside traditional attributes such as position, colour and size. The resulting visualisation is a dynamic scene; the relative positions of entities are not determined by a fixed layout algorithm, but by intuitive physical notions such as gravity, mass, and drag. The implementation is openly available, and we evaluate it on a selection of visualisation tasks for two openly-available software systems.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,A visual support for decomposing complex feature models,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"In Software Product Line (SPL) engineering, Feature Models (FMs) are widely used to capture and manage variability in a sound and organized fashion. Though semantics, notations and reasoning support are well established, maintaining large FMs is still an open problem. As large FMs naturally contain different concerns, some related to domains, others being inherently cross-cutting ones, it is challenging to find a decomposition that will tame this complexity and ease maintenance. This paper presents a visual representation of dependent FMs useful in decomposing a large FM while quantitatively visualizing constraints between and inside them. This Variability Blueprint is intuitive enough to enable the SPL maintainer to confine dependencies between FMs in a small set of identified features inside each decomposed FM. We describe our blueprint and report on its application on two case studies.",Feature Modeling;Visualization;Composition;Software Product Lines
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Revealing runtime features and constituent behaviors within software,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Software engineers organize source code into a dominant hierarchy of components and modules that may emphasize various characteristics over runtime behavior. In this way, runtime features may involve cross-cutting aspects of code from multiple components, and some of these features may be emergent in nature, rather than designed. Although source-code modularization assists software engineers to organize and find components, identifying such cross-cutting feature sets can be more difficult. This work presents a visualization that includes a static (i.e., compile-time) representation of source code that gives prominence to clusters of cooperating source-code instructions to identify dynamic (i.e., runtime) features and constituent behaviors within executions of the software. In addition, the visualization animates software executions to reveal which feature clusters are executed and in what order. The result has revealed the principal behaviors of software executions, and those behaviors were revealed to be (in some cases) cohesive, modular source-code structures and (in other cases) cross-cutting, emergent behaviors that involve multiple modules. In this paper, we describe our system (CEREBRO), envisage the uses to which it can be put, and evaluate its ability to reveal emergent runtime features and internal constituent behaviors of execution. We found that: (1) the visualization revealed emergent and commonly occuring functionalities that cross-cut the structural decomposition of the system; (2) four independent judges generally agreed in their interpretations of the code clusters, especially when informed only by our visualization; and (3) interacting with the external interface of an application while simultaneously observing the internal execution facilitated localization of code that implements the features and functionality evoked externally.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,CodeSurveyor: Mapping large-scale software to aid in code comprehension,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Large codebases - in the order of millions of lines of code (MLOC) - are incredibly complex. Whether fixing a fault, or implementing a new feature, changes to such systems often have unanticipated effects, as it is impossible for a developer to maintain a complete understanding of the code in their head. This paper presents CodeSurveyor, a spatial visualization technique that aims to support code comprehension in large codebases by allowing developers to view large-scale software at all levels of abstraction. It uses a cartographic metaphor to produce an interactive map of a codebase where users can zoom from a view of a system's high-level architectural components, represented as continents, down to the individual source files and the entities they define, shown as countries and states, respectively. The layout of the produced code map incorporates system dependency data and sizes regions according to a userconfigurable metric (line count by default), to create distinctive shapes and positions that serve as strong visual landmarks and keep users oriented. We detail the CodeSurveyor algorithm, show it generates code maps of the Linux kernel (1.4 MLOC) in 1.5 minutes, and evaluate the intuitiveness of the metaphor to software developers and its utility in navigation tasks. Results show the effectiveness of the approach with developers of varying experience levels.",software visualization;code comprehension
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,"Blended, not stirred: Multi-concern visualization of large software systems",VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"While constructing and evolving software systems, developers generate directly and indirectly a large amount of data of diverse nature, such as source code changes, bug tracking information, IDE interactions, stack traces, etc. Often these diverse data sources are processed and visualized in isolation, leading to a partial view of systems. We present a blended approach to visualize several data â€œingredientsâ€ at once, to give as complete an answer as possible to the question â€œWhat happened to the system in the last few days?â€. The goal is to enable a quick and comprehensive assessment of what happened to a software system in any given time frame.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Visualizing work processes in software engineering with developer rivers,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Work processes involving dozens or hundreds of collaborators are complex and difficult to manage. Problems within the process may have severe organizational and financial consequences. Visualization helps monitor and analyze those processes. In this paper, we study the development of large software systems as an example of a complex work process. We introduce Developer Rivers, a timeline-based visualization technique that shows how developers work on software modules. The flow of developers' activity is visualized by a river metaphor: activities are transferred between modules represented as rivers. Interactively switching between hierarchically organized modules and workload metrics allows for exploring multiple facets of the work process. We study typical development patterns by applying our visualization to Python and the Linux kernel.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Research perspective on supporting software engineering via physical 3D models,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Building architects, but also civil or mechanical engineers often build from their designs physical 3D models for a better presentation, comprehension, and communication among stakeholders. Software engineers usually create visualizations of their software designs as digital objects to be presented on a screen only. 3D software visualization metaphors, such as the software city metaphor, provide a basis for exporting those on-screen software visualizations into physical models. This can be achieved by 3D-printers to transfer the advantages of real, physical, tangible architecture models from traditional engineering disciplines to software engineering. We present a new research perspective of using physical models to support software engineering. Furthermore, we describe four envisioned usage scenarios for physical models which provide a plethora of new research topics. To examine the benefits of our concept, we investigate the first usage scenario by evaluating the impact of using physical models on program comprehension in teams through a first controlled experiment. Since the usage of physical models had a diverging influence for our chosen task set, we report on the qualitative results in this paper. We observed that the physical models improved the team-based program comprehension process for specific tasks by initiating gesture-based interaction.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Exploring software cities in virtual reality,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Software visualizations, such as the software city metaphor, are usually displayed on 2D screens and controlled by means of a mouse and thus often do not take advantage of more natural interaction techniques. Virtual reality (VR) approaches aim to improve the user experience. Emerging new technologies, like the Oculus Rift, dramatically enhance the VR experience at an affordable price. Therefore, new technologies have the potential to provide even higher immersion - and thus benefits - than previous VR approaches.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,From robots to humans: Visualizations for robot sensor data,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"In a robotics context, visualizing the data scanned by a robot is crucial to understand what the robot's sensors perceive about its environment. Consequently, robotic visualizations show these values in a 3-D world, such that they can be compared with the real world. However these visualizations do not allow developers to see this data in a manner that allows it to be interpreted for program construction. As a result, these visualizations are in many cases ineffective for programming robot behaviors. To address this issue, we have built several visualizations of robot sensor data for the programming of behaviors, and we report on them here. Our visualizations focus on better revealing the hard data, which allows developers to faster understand it and consequently to faster create and adapt robot behaviors.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Visualizing interactive and shared debugging sessions,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Debugging sessions require a methodical process of finding causes and reducing the number of software problems. During such sessions, developers run a software project, traversing method invocations, setting breakpoints, stopping or restarting executions. In these sessions, developers explore different parts of the code and create knowledge about them. When debugging sessions are over, it is likely that such knowledge is lost, and developers cannot use it in other sessions or sharing it with collaborators. We have developed Swarm Debugging, a new approach for visualizing and sharing information obtained during debugging sessions, providing interactive and real-time visualization techniques, and several searching tools. Through usage scenarios, we demonstrate that it can aid developers to decrease the required time for deciding where to toggle a break-point and locate bug causes. We show how Swarm Debugging offers more useful support for many typical development tasks than a traditional debugger tool.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,On understanding how developers use the Spotter search tool,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Analyzing how software engineers use the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is essential to better understanding how engineers carry out their daily tasks. SPOTTER is a code search engine for the Pharo programming language. Since its inception, SPOTTER has been rapidly and broadly adopted within the Pharo community. However, little is known about how practitioners employ SPOTTER to search and navigate within the Pharo code base. This paper evaluates how software engineers use SPOTTER in practice. To achieve this, we remotely gather user actions called events. These events are then visually rendered using an adequate navigation tool chain. Sequences of events are represented using a visual alphabet. We found a number of usage patterns and identified underused SPOTTER features. Such findings are essential for improving SPOTTER.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Unified model for software engineering data,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Software process data is available in several tools such as version control systems, issue trackers and test and build systems to name a few. Using the data gathered in these software engineering tools would be ideal for collecting different kinds of software processes and product metrics as the data is already automatically gathered by the tools. However, the tools present and store the data in various formats. The data collection methods and interfaces also vary between the tools. This closes the software engineering data into silos and makes it hard to build reusable analysis and visualizations for the data. In this position paper we present a unified model for software engineering data and a framework for data collection, conversion and storing that utilizes our model. The aim of the model is to define a common format for software engineering data which is not dependent on specific software engineering tools or the software engineering process and thus can be used as a basis for building reusable visualization and analysis components. To demonstrate that we can build reusable visualization plugins on top of the framework, we created a timeline visualization plugin. The visualization plugin is used to visualize two data sets from industrial software projects that have different contexts and semantics.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Visualization based API usage patterns refining,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Learning to use existing or new software libraries is a difficult task for software developers, which would impede their productivity. Most of existing work provided different techniques to mine API usage patterns from client programs, in order to help developers to understand and use existing libraries. However, considering only client programs to identify API usage patterns, is a strong constraint as collecting several similar client programs for an API is not a trivial task. And even if these clients are available, all the usage scenarios of the API of interest may not be covered by those clients. In this paper, we propose a visualization based approach for the refinement of Client-based Usage Patterns. We first visualize the patterns structure. Then we enrich the patterns with API methods that are semantically related to them, and thus may contribute together to the implementation of a particular functionality for potential client programs.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Pixel-oriented techniques for visualizing next-generation HPC systems,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Visualization schemas need to be enhanced to support next-generation high-performance computing (HPC) environments. New HPC runtimes perform more actions in a unit of time, but they also perform a wider variety of actions. Existing schemas are too simple to illustrate the variety of information that HPC developers need. However, existing schemas can be extended in simple ways to become more effective for next-generation HPC environments. This paper presents extensions to the common Vampir style plot that use high-definition alpha composition and color weaving. These two techniques incorporate new detail into the traditional plot style, providing useful information for HPC developers.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Extracting a unified directory tree to compare similar software products,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Source code is often reused in software development. Although developers can avoid re-implementing features in existing products, doing so may result in a large number of similar software products. To understand the commonalities and variabilities of similar products, comparing their source code is critical. However, a product may change its own directory structure, even if the products share the same source code with other products. Hence, comparing source code among products in a systematic manner is difficult. In this paper, we propose a technique to extract and visualize a unified directory tree to compare the source code of similar products. This tree includes all directories of given products and merges corresponding directories into a single node. Since a node in a tree corresponds to multiple directories in products, developers can easily compare the contents of products. In our study, we implemented the visualization as a GUI tool. In addition, we conducted a case study using four Android products to demonstrate the tool's ability to assist developers in accessing the source code of multiple products.",

It is specifically designed to handle the Linux kernel, a large and complex codebase. Use cases for this tool are numerous. The diagrams extracted from the C source code can be used to get a better insight of the control or data flow inside a program, or to evaluate the complexity of a function at a glance.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,SMNLV: A small-multiples node-link visualization supporting software comprehension by displaying multiple relationships in software structure,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Software engineering tasks like understanding of (legacy) software, checking guidelines, finding structure, or re-engineering of existing software require the analysis of the static software structure. The optimal visualization of this structure depends on the task at hand. In general, the software structure is mapped to a graph and graph drawing algorithms are used for displaying the structure. The task of drawing these graphs becomes more involved if not only one type of relations, e.g., call graphs, but many relation types should be analyzed at the same time. We propose a small-multiples node-link visualization, where each small visualization shows the graph related to one edge type. The visualizations are synchronized using selection and coordinated views. Using a separate view for each of the relations provides additional analysis capabilities. The main advantage of this approach is, that optimized drawing algorithms can be used for each type of relationship while being able to display multiple relationships at the same time.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Polyhedral user mapping and assistant visualizer tool for the r-stream auto-parallelizing compiler,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Existing high-level, source-to-source compilers can accept input programs in a high-level language (e.g., C) and perform complex automatic parallelization and other mappings using various optimizations. These optimizations often require trade-offs and can benefit from the user's involvement in the process. However, because of the inherent complexity, the barrier to entry for new users of these high-level optimizing compilers can often be high. We propose visualization as an effective gateway for non-expert users to gain insight into the effects of parameter choices and so aid them in the selection of levels best suited to their specific optimization goals.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Live visualization of GUI application code coverage with GUITracer,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"The present paper introduces the initial implementation of a software exploration tool targeting graphical user interface (GUI) driven applications. GUITracer facilitates the comprehension of GUI-driven applications by starting from their most conspicuous artefact - the user interface itself. The current implementation of the tool can be used with any Java-based target application that employs one of the AWT, Swing or SWT toolkits. The tool transparently instruments the target application and provides real time information about the GUI events fired. For each event, call relations within the application are displayed at method, class or package level, together with detailed coverage information. The tool facilitates feature location, program comprehension as well as GUI test creation by revealing the link between the application's GUI and its underlying code. As such, GUITracer is intended for software practitioners developing or maintaining GUI-driven applications. We believe our tool to be especially useful for entry-level practitioners as well as students seeking to understand complex GUI-driven software systems. The present paper details the rationale as well as the technical implementation of the tool. As a proof-of-concept implementation, we also discuss further development that can lead to our tool's integration into a software development workflow.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,OrionPlanning: Improving modularization and checking consistency on software architecture,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Many techniques have been proposed in the literature to support architecture definition, conformance, and analysis. However, there is a lack of adoption of such techniques by the industry. Previous work have analyzed this poor support. Specifically, former approaches lack proper analysis techniques (e.g., detection of architectural inconsistencies), and they do not provide extension and addition of new features. In this paper, we present ORIONPLANNING, a prototype tool to assist refactorings at large scale. The tool provides support for model-based refactoring operations. These operations are performed in an interactive visualization. The contributions of the tool consist in: (i) providing iterative modifications in the architecture, and (ii) providing an environment for architecture inspection and definition of dependency rules. We evaluate ORIONPLANNING against practitioners' requirements on architecture definition listed in a previous survey. We also evaluate the tool in a concrete example of software remodularization.",Software Architecture;Software Maintenance;Architecture Description Language;Architecture Conformance;Remodularization;Rearchitecting

In this paper we present Explora, a visualisation tool designed for the simultaneous analysis of multiple metrics of systems in software corpora. Explora incorporates a novel lightweight visualisation technique called PolyGrid that promotes the detection of graphical patterns. We present an example where we analyse the relation of subtype polymorphism with inheritance and invocation in corpora of Smalltalk and Java systems and find that (1) subtype polymorphism is more likely to be found in large hierarchies; (2) as class hierarchies grow horizontally, they also do so vertically; and (3) in polymorphic hierarchies the length of the name of the classes is orthogonal to the cardinality of the call sites.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Advancing data race investigation and classification through visualization,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Data races in multi-threaded programs are a common source of serious software failures. Their undefined behavior may lead to intermittent failures with unforeseeable, and in embedded systems, even life-threatening consequences. To mitigate these risks, various detection tools have been created to help identify potential data races. However, these tools produce thousands of data race warnings, often in text-based format, which makes the manual assessment process slow and error-prone. Through visualization, we aim to speed up the data race assessment process by reducing the amount of information to be investigated, and to provide a versatile interface that quality assurance engineers can use to investigate data race warnings. The ultimate goal of our integrated software suite, called RaceView, is to improve the usability of the data race information to such an extent that the elimination of data races can be incorporated into the regular software development process.",multi-threading;static analysis;data race detection;user interface;graph visualization;graph navigation
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,"SPIDER SENSE: Software-engineering, networked, system evaluation",VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Today, many of the research innovations in software visualization and comprehension are evaluated on small-scale programs in a way that avoids actual human evaluation, despite the fact that these techniques are designed to help programmers develop and understand large and complex software. The investments required to perform such human studies often outweigh the need to publish. As such, the goal of this work (and toolkit) is to enable the evaluation of software visualizations of real-life software systems by its actual developers, as well as to understand the factors that influence adoption. The approach is to directly assist practicing software developers with visualizations through open and online collaboration tools. The mechanism by which we accomplish this goal is an online service that is linked through the projects' revision-control and build systems. We are calling this system SPIDER SENSE, and it includes web-based visualizations for software exploration that is supported by tools for mirroring development activities, automatic building and testing, and automatic instrumentation to gather dynamic-analysis data. In the future, we envision the system and toolkit to become a framework on which further visualizations and analyses are developed. SPIDER SENSE is open-source and publicly available for download and collaborative development.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,XVIZIT: Visualizing cognitive units in spreadsheets,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Spreadsheets can be large and complex and their maintenance and comprehension difficult to end-users. Large numbers of cells, complex formulae and missing documentation can impede the understanding of a spreadsheet. Comprehension assesses different levels of a spreadsheet according to a specific maintenance task, ranging from single formulae over sets of cells to complex structural patterns. These levels of abstraction are subsumed under the term cognitive unit. XVIZIT helps end-users in maintaining and comprehending spreadsheets. It guides them through a spreadsheet model: Roles of cells and sheets, similar patterns and various concepts of modularity can be explored. It uses modularization algorithms to provide conceptional decompositions of a spreadsheet model, such as equivalence classes or data modules. XVIZIT's slice visualizations ease the evaluation of corrective modifications by showing the dependant cells. Furthermore, XVIZIT provides a number of complexity measures allowing end-users to estimate the effort to comprehend and maintain a spreadsheet.",

IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Keynote 1: Visualization for Software Analytics by Margaret-Anne (Peggy) Storey,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"The popularity of software visualization research over the past 30 years has led to innovative techniques that are now seeing widespread adoption by professional software practitioners. But this research has barely kept pace with some of the radical changes occurring in software engineering today. In this talk, I explore current trends in software engineering, including the prevalence of software ecosystems and software delivery as a service, and the emergence of the social coder within a participatory development culture. I will also discuss how the field of software analytics has matured and seeks to support practitioners in improving software quality, user experience and developer productivity through data-driven tasks. Finally, I suggest that software visualization should be playing a bigger role in these recent trends, emphasizing that interactive visualizations are poised to play a critical role in the field of software analytics.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Keynote 2: Visualization and Human Vision: A Tale of Two Systems by Ronald A. Rensink,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"This presentation will present some of the breakthroughs that have recently occurred in our understanding of human vision, and discuss how they might inform the design of more effective ways to visualize information. For example, although it appears to us as observers that we always see everything in front of us, recent work in visual perception has shown that this is not true: observers can have great difficulty noticing changes that occur during a brief interruption or eye movement, even if these changes are large and the observer expects them. This â€œchange blindnessâ€ has formed the basis for considerable research over the past decade into issues such as how much of a scene is remembered, what kinds of memory systems are involved, and what role is played by visual attention. Several of the highlights of this line of research will be discussed, including the proposal that scene perception is based on a dynamic â€œjust-in-timeâ€ process, relying on a careful interplay between internal knowledge and external information. It will then be argued that the operation of this system is similar in important ways to how humans access information via interactive visualization systems, and that this similarity can be the basis of insight into the limitations of visualization, as well as possible ways of overcoming these limitations.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Combining Tiled and Textual Views of Code,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Jigsaw puzzle programming environments manipulate programs primarily by drag-and-drop. Generally these environments are based on their own special-purpose languages, meaning students must move on to another language as their programs grow. Tiled Grace is a tile-based editor for Grace, an educational programming language with a conventional textual syntax. Using Tiled Grace, programmers can move seamlessly between visualising their programs as tiles or source code, editing their programs via tiles or text, and continue on to traditional textual environments, all within the same programming language. We conducted a user experiment with Tiled Grace, and present the results of that experiment showing that users find dual views helpful.",Grace;visual languages;drag-and-drop;multiple views;programming languages;experiment
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Integrating Anomaly Diagnosis Techniques into Spreadsheet Environments,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Although spreadsheets are often faulty, end-users like them for their flexibility. Most existing approaches to spreadsheet diagnosis are fully automated and use static analysis techniques to find anomalies in formulas or methods to derive test cases without user interaction. The few more interactive approaches are based on values already present in spreadsheets as well. In our work, we advance the idea of testing spreadsheets with user-defined test scenarios but encourage visually aided creation of independent test cases by separating the definition of test scenarios from the specific values present in the spreadsheet - just like test code is separated from production code in professional software. We combine the testing approach with static analysis and integrate it into a common visual spreadsheet environment named SIFEI. It supports users in interactively creating, executing, and analyzing their own test scenarios with a number of visual markers. Findings from two qualitative studies indicate that the concept is suitable for casual spreadsheet users.",spreadsheet;anomaly;detection;testing;defect;failure;diagnosis
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Action-Based Visualization,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Many commonly used systems, for example event-based systems, can be considered action systems. Traditionally, action systems have only been visualized behaviorally using state diagrams, which requires translating the system into a state machine and discarding structural information. We introduce an action-based diagram and associated formalism that depict both the behavior and the structure of the system as actions, objects, and participations. The diagrams are useful for visualizing action systems in a native format and can provide an action-oriented viewpoint for other systems as well.",action diagrams;action systems;event-based systems;visualization
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Slicing-Based Techniques for Visualizing Large Metamodels,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"In model-driven engineering, a model describes an aspect of a system. A model conforms to a metamodel that defines the concepts and relationships of a given domain. Metamodels are thus corner-stones of various meta-modeling activities that require a good understanding of the metamodels or parts of them. Current metamodel editing tools are based on standard visualization and navigation features, such as physical zooms. However, as soon as metamodels become larger, navigating through large metamodels becomes a tedious task that hinders their understanding. In this work, we promote the use of model slicing techniques to build visualization techniques dedicated to metamodels. We propose an approach based on model slicing, inspired from program slicing, to build interactive visualization techniques dedicated to metamodels. These techniques permit users to focus on metamodel elements of interest, which aims at improving the understand ability. This approach is implemented in a metamodel visualizer, called Explen.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Search Space Pruning Constraints Visualization,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"The field of software optimization, among others, is interested in finding an optimal solution in a large search space. These search spaces are often large, complex, non-linear and even non-continuous at times. The size of the search space makes a brute force solution intractable. As a result, one or more search space pruning constraints are often used to reduce the number of candidate configurations that must be evaluated in order to solve the optimization problem. If more than one pruning constraint is employed, it can be challenging to understand how the pruning constraints interact and overlap. This work presents a visualization technique based on a radial, space-filling technique that allows the user to gain a better understanding of how the pruning constraints remove candidates from the search space. The technique is then demonstrated using a search space pruning data set derived from the optimization of a matrix multiplication code for NVIDIA CUDA accelerators.",Search Space Pruning;Visualization
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Livecoding the SynthKit: Little Bits as an Embodied Programming Language,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"LittleBits (little Bits.cc) is an open-source hardware library of pre-assembled analogue components that can be easily assembled into circuits, disassembled, reassembled, and re-used. In this paper, we consider littleBits - and the littleBits SynthKit in particular -- as a physically-embodied domain specific programming language. We describe the littleBits system, explain how littleBits ""programs"" are constructed as configurations of physical modules in the real world, and describe how they are typically used to control physical artefacts or constructions. We then argue that littleBits constructions essentially ""visualise themselves"". We describe how littleBits' liveness, embodiment, and plasticity assists both learning and debugging, and then evaluate littleBits configurations according to the cognitive dimensions of notations.",little Bits;livecoding

However, adequately visualizing software dependencies as a graph is a non-trivial problem due to the pluridimentional nature of software. We have designed a domain-specific language for visualizing software dependencies as graphs that is both expressive and concise.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Feature Relations Graphs: A Visualisation Paradigm for Feature Constraints in Software Product Lines,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Software Product Line Engineering is a mature approach enabling the derivation of product variants by assembling reusable assets. In this context, domain experts widely use Feature Models as the most accepted formalism for capturing commonality and variability in terms of features. Feature Models also describe the constraints in feature combinations. In industrial settings, domain experts often deal with Software Product Lines with high numbers of features and constraints. Furthermore, the set of features are often regrouped in different subsets that are overseen by different stakeholders in the process. Consequently, the management of the complexity of large Feature Models becomes challenging. In this paper we propose a dedicated interactive visualisation paradigm to help domain experts and stakeholders to manage the challenges in maintaining the constraints among features. We build Feature Relations Graphs (Frogs) by mining existing product configurations. For each feature, we are able to display a Frog which shows the impact, in terms of constraints, of the considered feature on all the other features. The objective is to help domain experts to 1) obtain a better understanding of feature constraints, 2) potentially refine the existing feature model by uncovering and formalizing missing constraints and 3) serve as a recommendation system, during the configuration of a new product, based on the tendencies found in existing configurations. The paper illustrates the visualisation paradigm with the industrial case study of Renault's Electric Parking System Software Product Line.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Validation of Software Visualization Tools: A Systematic Mapping Study,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Software visualization as a research field focuses on the visualization of the structure, behavior, and evolution of software. It studies techniques and methods for graphically representing these different aspects of software. Interest in software visualization has grown in recent years, producing rapid advances in the diversity of research and in the scope of proposed techniques, and aiding the application experts who use these techniques to advance their own research. Despite the importance of evaluating software visualization research, there is little work studying validation methods. As a consequence, it is usually difficult producing compelling evidence about the effectiveness of software visualization contributions. The goal of this paper is to study the validation techniques performed in the software visualization literature. We conducted a systematic mapping study of validation methods in software visualization. We consider 752 articles from multiple sources, published between 2000 and 2012, and study the validation techniques of the software visualization articles. The main outcome of this study is the lack in rigor when validating software visualization tool and techniques. Although software visualization has grown in interest in the last decade, it still lacks the necessary maturity to be properly and thoroughly evaluating its claims. Most article evaluations studied in this paper are qualitative case studies, including discussions about the benefits of the proposed visualizations. The results help understand the needs in software visualization validation techniques. They identify the type of evaluations that should be performed to address this deficiency. The specific analysis of SOFTVIS series articles shows that the specialized conference suffers from the same shortage.",Software visualization;Validation techniques;Systematic mapping study
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Using a Task-Oriented Framework to Characterize Visualization Approaches,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Visualization approaches support stakeholders in a variety of tasks. However, they are spread in the literature and their information is usually not clearly organized, classified and categorized, which makes them hard to be found and used in practice. This paper presents the use of a task-oriented framework in the context of a characterization study of visualizations that provide support for software reuse tasks. Such framework was extended in order to capture more detailed information that may be useful for assessing the suitability of a particular visualization. Besides enabling a better organization of the findings, the use of the extended framework allows to identify aspects that lack more support, indicating opportunities for researchers on software reuse and software visualization.",Software visualization;knowledge structuring;taxonomy framework;software reuse
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Mr. Clean: A Tool for Tracking and Comparing the Lineage of Scientific Visualization Code,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Visualization is a key step in scientific analysis and understanding in many fields. Scientific studies often require development of software that produces visualizations. However, as a study proceeds, the software evolves, and both developers and expert users have to periodically ascertain how code modifications affect visualization output and hence the results of the study. To our knowledge, no current visualization framework enables tracking and comparison of the lineage of scientific visualizations. We describe an approach for comparing and maintaining the code for scientific analysis and modeling through interactive comparison of visualization output. We have realized this approach in a tool called Mr. Clean. This tool provides a framework for combining different visualization tools, interaction devices, and display middleware for visual comparisons on high-resolution displays. Mr. Clean also provides user-configurable interactions supported by many devices. We provide use cases and a requirement analysis for our approach, and we describe the design and implementation of Mr. Clean.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Polyptychon: A Hierarchically-Constrained Classified Dependencies Visualization,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Architects and developers are often tasked with evaluating or maintaining unfamiliar software systems. Reverse engineering tools help extract relationships between the system parts as they exist instead of as documented. Though node-link diagrams have a straightforward correspondence with the graph-represent able data generated, the scale and complexity of real-world data sets prevent efficient comprehension. This paper presents Polyptychon, an interactive node-link visualization designed for incremental exploration of dependency information. Given a hierarchical information space of software artifacts, Polyptychon constrains the visible dependencies to be related to the child nodes of a specified artifact node, called a view root. It then classifies these siblings as levelized, tangled and independent. It also includes context nodes, which are a filtered set of nodes elsewhere in the hierarchy that are related to the siblings. The context nodes are further grouped based on a project-specific partition function. The hierarchical constraints and partition function provide means to control the number of nodes displayed, while the dependency classification allows users to form a qualitative impression of the dependency structure. We demonstrate with examples from the Netty open source project. We conclude with areas of future work, in particular, as a basis of evolutionary dependency analysis.",software visualization;software dependencies;hierarchical node-link diagrams;interactive visualization;strongly connected components
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,How Developers Visualize Compiler Messages: A Foundational Approach to Notification Construction,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Self-explanation is one cognitive strategy through which developers comprehend error notifications. Self-explanation, when left solely to developers, can result in a significant loss of productivity because humans are imperfect and bounded in their cognitive abilities. We argue that modern IDEs offer limited visual affordances for aiding developers with self-explanation, because compilers do not reveal their reasoning about the causes of errors to the developer. The contribution of our paper is a foundational set of visual annotations that aid developers in better comprehending error messages when compilers expose their internal reasoning. We demonstrate through a user study of 28 undergraduate Software Engineering students that our annotations align with the way in which developers self-explain error notifications. We show that these annotations allow developers to give significantly better self-explanations when compared against today's dominant visualization paradigm, and that better self-explanations yield better mental models of notifications. The results of our work suggest that the diagrammatic techniques developers use to explain problems can serve as an effective foundation for how IDEs should visually communicate to developers.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Lightweight Structured Visualization of Assembler Control Flow Based on Regular Expressions,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"RegVIS is a tool for viewing directed graphs with start and end nodes. It applies a new visualization technique, which uses regular expressions as a meta-representation of all the paths in an input graph, the result is a containment-based and structured visualization of that graph. The tool can be configured to derive these regular expressions from the input graph using either the Brzozowski algebraic method or the transitive closure method. Regvis can be used in combination with the binary code analysis tool IDA (Interactive Disassembler), either integrated or standalone, to view the control flow graph (CFG) of assembler code. The resulting visualization, which restructures the control flow and can thus help reduce program comprehension efforts, is called control flow blocks (CFB). In this paper, we present the workings of regVIS and evaluate the new CFB visualization it produces against the traditional CFG visualization in an explorative user study. The study suggests that the CFB is better for analyzing and navigating along specific execution paths, while the CFG is better for getting an overview of the overall control flow.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Templated Visualization of Object State with Vebugger,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Software developers often need to inspect the state of objects during debugging. Existing debuggers display a textual representation of the state of selected objects. While these textual representations often contain enough information, they are also difficult to comprehend. For example, an object that represents a color is traditionally represented by listing the numbers that comprise its RGB values. This representation, while complete, is hardly comprehensible. We describe Vebugger, an IDE plug in for Eclipse that displays object state visually. Recalling the previous example, Vebugger displays the actual color that a Color object represents in addition to its RGB values. This representation is easier to understand. Vebugger visualizes object types using a set of extensible templates. These templates are written in HTML and CSS, and they are matched to Java types by inspecting the type hierarchy. We developed a dozen such templates for a diverse set of Java types to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. Vebugger is preliminary work, we also detail future research directions and our planned evaluation strategy.",object visualization;visualization templates;vebugger
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,The Challenge of Helping the Programmer during Debugging,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Programmers spend considerable time debugging their systems. They add logging statements and use debuggers to run their systems in a controlled environment all in an attempt to understand what is happening as their program executes. Our hypothesis is that visualization tools can significantly improve the debugging process. A wide variety of tools have been developed for visualizing and understanding the dynamics of program execution. These tools can provide lots of information about executions. However, most tools are not designed to be used with a debugger. What is needed are tools that can work while the programmer is debugging a system and that provide the information the programmer needs to understand and assist the debugging process. We have started to develop such tools within the context of the Code Bubbles development environment. However, there is much room for improvement and we call upon the software visualization community to think about and develop practical tools that will improve the debugging process.",Software visualization;dynamic visualization;debugging
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,ChronoTwigger: A Visual Analytics Tool for Understanding Source and Test Co-evolution,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Applying visual analytics to large software systems can help users comprehend the wealth of information produced by source repository mining. One concept of interest is the co-evolution of test code with source code, or how source and test files develop together over time. For example, understanding how the testing pace compares to the development pace can help test managers gauge the effectiveness of their testing strategy. A useful concept that has yet to be effectively incorporated into a co-evolution visualization is co-change. Co-change is a quantity that identifies correlations between software artifacts, and we propose using this to organize our visualization in order to enrich the analysis of co-evolution. In this paper, we create, implement, and study an interactive visual analytics tool that displays source and test file changes over time (co-evolution) while grouping files that change together (co-change). Our new technique improves the analyst's ability to infer information about the software development process and its relationship to testing. We discuss the development of our system and the results of a small pilot study with three participants. Our findings show that our visualization can lead to inferences that are not easily made using other techniques alone.",Co-evolution;co-change;mining software repositories;information visualization;temporal data visualization;3D visualization;visual analytics
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Visualizing the Evolution of Systems and Their Library Dependencies,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"System maintainers face several challenges stemming from a system and its library dependencies evolving separately. Novice maintainers may lack the historical knowledge required to efficiently manage an inherited system. While some libraries are regularly updated, some systems keep a dependency on older versions. On the other hand, maintainers may be unaware that other systems have settled on a different version of a library. In this paper, we visualize how the dependency relation between a system and its dependencies evolves from two perspectives. Our system-centric dependency plots (SDP) visualize the successive library versions a system depends on over time. The radial layout and heat-map metaphor provide visual clues about the change in dependencies along the system's release history. From this perspective, maintainers can navigate to a library-centric dependants diffusion plot (LDP). The LDP is a time-series visualization that shows the diffusion of users across the different versions of a library. We demonstrate on real-world systems how maintainers can benefit from our visualizations through four case scenarios.",Software Evolution;Software Reuse;Software Maintenance
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,AniMatrix: A Matrix-Based Visualization of Software Evolution,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Software designs are ever changing to adapt to new environments and requirements. Tracking and understanding changes in modules and relationships in a software project is difficult, but even more so when the software goes through several types of changes. The typical complexity and size of software also makes it harder to grasp software evolution patterns. In this paper, we present an interactive matrix-based visualization technique that, combined with animation, depicts how software designs evolve. For example, it shows which new modules and couplings are added and removed over time. Our generic visualization supports dynamic and weighted digraphs and is applied in the context of software evolution. Analyzing source code changes is important to determine the software's structural organization and identify quality issues over time. To demonstrate our approach, we explore open-source repositories and discuss some of our findings regarding these evolving software designs.",network visualization;matrix visualization;software visualization;software evolution;software design

IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,FAVe: Visualizing User Feedback for Software Evolution,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"App users can submit feedback about downloaded apps by writing review comments and giving star ratings directly in the distribution platforms. Previous research has shown that this type of feedback contains important information for software evolution. However, in the case of the most popular apps, the amount of received feedback and its unstructured nature can produce difficulties in its analysis. We present an interactive user feedback visualization which displays app reviews from four different points of view: general, review based, feature based and topic-feature based. We conducted a study which visualized 2009 reviews from the Dropbox app available in the App Store. Participants considered the approach useful for software evolution tasks as they found it could aid developers and analysts get an overview of the most and least popular app features, and to prioritize their work. While using different strategies to find relevant information during the study, most participants came to the same conclusions regarding the user reviews and assigned tasks.",

IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Synchrovis: 3D visualization of monitoring traces in the city metaphor for analyzing concurrency,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"The increasing code complexity in modern software systems exceeds the capabilities of most software engineers to understand the system's behavior by just looking at its program code. The addition of concurrency issues through the advent of multi-core processors in the consumer market further escalates this complexity. A solution to these problems is visualizing a model of the system to ease program comprehension. Especially for the comprehension of concurrency issues, static information is often not sufficient. For this purpose, profiling and monitoring can provide additional information on the actual behavior of a system. An established visualization approach is the 3D city metaphor. It utilizes the familiarity with navigating a city to improve program comprehension. In this paper, we present our trace-based SynchroVis 3D visualization approach for concurrency. It employs the city metaphor to visualize both static and dynamic properties of software systems with a focus on illustrating the concurrent behavior. To evaluate our approach, we provide an open source implementation of our concepts and present an exemplary dining philosophers scenario showing its feasibility.",

To this end, we first propose a framework to unify the two main software dynamicities, execution and evolution. Then, this unified framework is exploited to define a visualization environment based on heat maps. We illustrate our approach on two comprehension tasks: understanding the behavior of programmers during the evolution of an application and understanding class contributions in use cases. The case studies show that the heat-map metaphor contributes to answer, more easily, many of the questions important to program comprehension.",

ClonEvol combines information obtained from the software versioning system and contents of files that change between versions; The tool operates as tool-chain of Subversion (SVN), Doxygen (applied as static analyzer) and Simian as code duplication detector. The consolidated information is presented to the user in an interactive visual manner. The focus of the presented tool lies on scalability (in time and space) concerning data acquisition, data processing and visualization, and ease of use. The visualization is approached by using a (mirrored) radial tree to show the file and scope structures, complemented with hierarchically bundled edges that show clone relations. We demonstrate the use of ClonEvol on a real world code base.",Software Visualization;Software Evolution Analysis;Code Clones

IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,CodeMetrpolis â€” A minecraft based collaboration tool for developers,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Data visualisation with high expressive power plays an important role in code comprehension. Recent visualisation tools try to fulfill the expectations of the users and use various analogies. For example, in an architectural metaphor, each class is represented by a building. Buildings are grouped into districts according to the structure of the namespaces. We think that these unique ways of code representation have great potential, but in our opinion they use very simple graphical techniques (shapes, figures, low resolution) to visualise the structure of the source code. On the other hand, computer games use high quality graphic and have high expressive power. A good example is Minecraft, a popular role playing game that supports both high definition, photorealistic textures and long range 3D scene displaying. Additionally, it provides great extensibility and interactivity for third party software. In this paper, we introduce our mission to create a virtual world of source code in which developers and other stakeholders could explore and evaluate their project collaboratively in a virtual Minecraft world. Code properties are represented by graphical primitives offered by the game engine, and various interactivity features are planned. Besides challenges of the implementation there are some fundamental research issues considering the selection of a set of visual elements and mapping to source code properties. These elements have to be compatible not only with the visualisation and with the data model but also with the thinking of developers.",Source code visualisation;game engine;Minecraft;source code metrics

With the growing trend of distributed teams and textual communication this type of awareness is more difficult to obtain and maintain. We propose to improve emotional climate awareness in software development projects by means of a visualization prototype which includes general and detailed views of the topics and emotions expressed in software project collaboration artifacts. We performed an initial case study in which the mailing list content of a software project was visualized. The study suggests that the length, frequency and emotion diversity of the exchanged content varies according to the project phase. However, a more extensive evaluation needs to be made.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Finding structures in multi-type code couplings with node-link and matrix visualizations,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Software systems are often modeled and visualized as graphs in order to understand their higher-level structure: code entities are connected by dependencies or couplings. However, when only considering one type of code coupling such as method calls, the understanding gained stays limited to this specific aspect. Encoding multiple types of code coupling in the graph promises to broaden the understanding. Different approaches already exist for visually discerning those types in graph diagrams. In this paper, we study two of these techniquesa node-link and a matrix approach-in a realistic scenario where the classes and interfaces of a system are connected by six different types of code coupling. The explorative user study that we conducted with interactive versions of the two visualizations focuses on getting an insight on how software developers use the visualizations for understanding an unknown system. We classified typical visual structures that the participants were able to identify and connected these structures to software engineering problems. Despite the fundamental difference in approach, the participants identified the same graph structures targeting similar tasks with both visualizations.",

IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Visualizing jobs with shared resources in distributed environments,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"In this paper we describe a visualization system that shows the behavior of jobs in large, distributed computing clusters. The system has been in use for two years, and is sufficiently generic to be applied in two quite different domains: a Hadoop MapReduce environment and the Watson DeepQA DUCC cluster. Scalable and flexible data processing systems typically run hundreds or more of simultaneous jobs. The creation, termination, expansion and contraction of these jobs can be very dynamic and transient, and it is difficult to understand this behavior without showing its evolution over time. While traditional monitoring tools typically show either snapshots of the current load balancing or aggregate trends over time, our new visualization technique shows the behavior of each of the jobs over time in the context of the cluster, and in either a real-time or post-mortem view. Its new algorithm runs in realtime mode and can make retroactive adjustments to produce smooth layouts. Moreover, our system allows users to drill down to see details about individual jobs. The visualization has been proven useful for administrators to see the overall occupancy, trends and job allocations in the cluster, and for users to spot errors or to monitor how many resources are given to their jobs.",Visualizing jobs;stacked charts;time graphs;load balancing;MapReduce visualization;cluster management
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Live trace visualization for comprehending large software landscapes: The ExplorViz approach,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"The increasing code complexity in modern enterprise software systems exceeds the capabilities of most software engineers to understand the system's behavior by just looking at its program code. Large software landscapes, e.g., applications in a cloud infrastructure, further increase this complexity. A solution to these problems is visualizing the applications of the software landscape to ease program comprehension and to understand the respective communication. An established visualization concept is the 3D city metaphor. It utilizes the familiarity with navigating a city to improve program comprehension. Dynamic analysis, e.g., monitoring, can provide the required program traces of the communication. In this paper, we present our live visualization approach of monitoring traces for large software landscapes. It combines a landscape and a system level perspective. The landscape level perspective provides an overview of the software landscape utilizing the viewer's familiarity with UML. The system level perspective provides a visualization utilizing the city metaphor for each software system.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Visualizing constituent behaviors within executions,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"In this New Ideas and Emerging Results paper, we present a novel visualization, THE BRAIN, that reveals clusters of source code that co-execute to produce behavioral features of the program throughout and within executions. We created a clustered visualization of source-code that is informed by dynamic control flow of multiple executions; each cluster represents commonly interacting logic that composes software features. In addition, we render individual executions atop the clustered multiple-execution visualization as user-controlled animations to reveal characteristics of specific executions-these animations may provide exemplars for the clustered features and provide chronology for those behavioral features, or they may reveal anomalous behaviors that do not fit with the overall operational profile of most executions. Both the clustered multiple-execution view and the animated individual-execution view provide insights for the constituent behaviors within executions that compose behaviors of whole executions. Inspired by neural imaging of human brains of people who were subjected to various external stimuli, we designed and implemented THE BRAIN to reveal program activity during execution. The result has revealed the principal behaviors of execution, and those behaviors were revealed to be (in some cases) cohesive, modular source-code structures and (in other cases) cross-cutting, emergent behaviors that involve multiple modules. In this paper, we describe THE BRAIN and envisage the uses to which it can be put, and we provide two example usage scenarios to demonstrate its utility.",

IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Using HTML5 visualizations in software fault localization,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Testing and debugging is the most expensive, error-prone phase in the software development life cycle. Automated software fault localization can drastically improve the efficiency of this phase, thus improving the overall quality of the software. Amongst the most well-known techniques, due to its efficiency and effectiveness, is spectrum-based fault localization. In this paper, we propose three dynamic graphical forms using HTML5 to display the diagnostic reports yielded by spectrum-based fault localization. The visualizations proposed, namely Sunburst, Vertical Partition, and Bubble Hierarchy, have been implemented within the GZOLTAR toolset, replacing previous and less-intuitive OpenGL-based visualizations. The GZOLTAR toolset is a plug-and-play plugin for the Eclipse IDE to ease world-wide adoption. Finally, we performed an user study with GZOLTAR and confirmed that the visualizations help to drastically reduce the time needed in debugging (e.g., all participants using the visualizations were able to pinpoint the fault, whereas of those using traditional methods only 35% found the fault). The group that used the visualizations took on average 9 minutes and 17 seconds less than the group that did not use them.",Automatic Debugging;Reports;Visualizations;GZOLTAR
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Automatic categorization and visualization of lock behavior,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"We consider the problem of understanding locking behavior in large Java programs using a combination of data collection, data analysis, and visualization. Our technique starts by collecting partial information about all locks used in the program. It then analyzes this information to determine sets of locks with common behaviors and to determine, for each set of locks, how that lock is used, e.g. if it is used as a mutex, semaphore, read-write lock, etc. The result of the analysis is then presented to the user who can select specific locks for full analysis during a subsequent run. Visualizing locking information is particularly difficult since the time scale of a lock can be ten or more orders of magnitude different from the time scale of the overall run and locks can be used millions of times. We provide different visualizations and visualization techniques for this purpose. First, we analyze either the partial or full traces and identify patterns of how each lock is used and display just those patterns along with their frequency. Second, we provide a thread-centric view of locking that supports fish-eye views at the microsecond level as well as time compression. Third, we provide a lock-centric view that is based on the specific type of lock to show its particular behavior.",Locking synchronization;software visualization
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Lightweight software reverse engineering using augmented matrix visualizations,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Empirical studies show that understanding existing software is a cost driver in maintenance activities and throughout the software development lifecycle. Presenting large software systems visually to support reverse engineering requires having the right summary to convey the important details. An experienced engineer knows the important details and can customize the view accordingly. In a reverse engineering context without this upfront knowledge and experience, any derived insights are strongly dependent on the (perhaps incorrectly) chosen view. We propose a lightweight visual approach to reverse engineering that supports users in interactively extracting high-level information from software at large scales with little or no upfront system knowledge. To support this we provide a matrix-based visualization method capable of displaying full systems in space-constrained views. The view visually emphasizes high level structural properties and employs a novel dependency display method to summarize and aggregate dependencies as the view changes, eliminating the need for user-directed aggregation decisions. We describe the visualization concept and a prototype tool that supports it, provide an example from the Apache HttpComponents Client open source project, and offer some areas of future work.",software visualization;design structure matrix;reverse engineering;dependencies;dependency clustering

IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Towards interactive visualization support for pairwise testing software product lines,VISSOFT - International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis,B,"Software Product Lines (SPLs) are families of related software products. SPL practices have proven substantial technological and economical benefits such as improved software reuse and reduced time to market. Software testing is a key development activity in SPLs, and it is uniquely challenging because of the usually large number of feature combinations present in typical SPLs. Pairwise testing is a combinatorial testing technique that aims at selecting products to test based on the pairs of feature combinations such products provide. Our previous work on evolutionary approaches for SPL testing and their comparative analysis has yielded a large amount of data that prompted us to explore ways by which to convey and represent this information. In this paper we present our early results in this effort. We describe three basic visualization applications to pairwise testing and highlight some of the open questions that we foresee. But most importantly, our driving goal is both to raise the awareness of the visualization problems in this area and to spark the interest of the software visualization community.",

To make the monitoring of numeric variables easier, this work introduces a visualization approach that augments the source code view of an IDE by small, word-sized graphics: the visualizations accompanying the declarations of monitored variables plot read and write accesses on a timeline; detail views can be retrieved on demand. As suggested by a case study, this approach might support program comprehension and debugging.",

In addition, CHRONOS provides change history across all historical versions (i.e., it is not limited to a pairwise â€œdiffâ€). The tool implements a zoom-able user interface as a visualization of the history of the queried code to provide both a high-level view of the changes, which supports pattern recognition and discovery, and a low-level view that supports semantic comprehension for tasks such as reverse engineering and identifying design rationale.

However, the need for scalable visualizations, which take into account the increasing number of code entities (classes and interfaces) and different types of code couplings (relations between them) in software systems, is still not sufficiently fulfilled. In this paper, we extend the design of an existing multi-matrix visualization approach to represent the static structure of software systems in a scalable way. First, we extended the data model and the algorithms. Second, we added more visualization and interaction elements. Finally, we incorporated the folding (collapsing) and the unfolding (expanding) of the package hierarchy, which have quadratic time complexity and quadratic space complexity in the number of nodes. This extended approach can be applied to support program comprehension and to analyze the static structure of software systems.",

It provides a graphical user interface and configurable environment for application building. Users can focus on the design and functionality parts rather than the technical details of programming languages. This can lead to a faster and more efficient development process. However, most of the low-code platforms are mainly used on web pages through traditional interactive devices like mouse and keyboard. To the best of our knowledge, we found there are currently few tools for creating visual interfaces using free-hand manipulation in AR. Interactions in current AR are mostly limited to the two-dimensional display space of screens. Thus, we propose NCARVis, a LCDP that is a novel visualization interface-creating system, it can help users create and show visualization without any programming skills. To provide an environment for creating visualization in NCARVis, we have proposed an initial prototype (MARLP) that changes the interaction method of only touching the 2D screen in the traditional AR scene and provides more interaction methods in AR. Users can freely explore virtual worlds through it, interacting in different directions, and have more creative space to place all diagrams than a 2D scene. We present two tasks for five users without any programming skills to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of NCARVis in visualization creation and design. And we compare NCARVis with a graphical low-code development platform to evaluate the advantages of NCARVis on learning cost.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Understanding Peopleâ€™s Needs in Viewing Diverse Social Opinions about Controversial Topics,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Social media (i.e., Reddit) users are overloaded with peopleâ€™s opinions when viewing discourses about divisive topics. Traditional user interfaces in such media present those opinions in a linear structure, which can limit users in viewing diverse social opinions at scale. Prior work has recognized this limitation, that the linear structure can reinforce biases, where a certain point of view becomes widespread simply because many viewers seem to believe it. This limitation can make it difficult for users to have a truly conversational mode of mediated discussion. Thus, when designing a user interface for viewing peopleâ€™s opinions, we should consider ways to mitigate selective exposure to information and polarization of opinions. We conducted a needs-finding study with 11 Reddit users, who follow climate change threads and make posts and comments regularly. In the study, we aimed to understand key limitations in people viewing online controversial discourses and to extract design implications to address these problems.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,"A Study of Zooming, Interactive Lenses and Overview+Detail Techniques in Collaborative Map-based Tasks",PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"The support for multi-focus data exploration is vital in collaborative visualization. In these scenarios, which often involve multiple devices and large displays, users may focus on specific information on their individual screens while also sharing contextual views with others. While many visualization techniques developed for single-user applications can be adapted for use in collaborative settings, little research has been done on how to design adaptive versions of these techniques or how they may impact collaborative tasks involving large datasets. In this work, we perform a comparative study of three collaborative visualization techniques (Zooming, Interactive lenses and Overview+Detail) on large displays in three map-based visualization tasks (Exploration, Comparison and Spatial Memorizing). These three collaborative techniques draw on three different classical visualization techniques in a single-user setting. Our results show that these techniques have different impacts on usersâ€™ task performance and preferences. The collaborative Overview+Detail technique benefits users most in supporting Spatial Memorizing. Closely coupled groups prefer collaborative Zooming in Target Exploration. Based on these results, we further discuss the design of collaborative visualization techniques and propose suggestions for adapting classical single-user visualization techniques to a collaborative setting.",Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization design and evaluation methods

Difference in the natures of these properties raises challenges when combining them for analysis. This paper presents the design of a tool that enables the exploration of multivariate heterogeneous data by combining the strengths of Parallel Coordinates and Parallel Sets. The design relied on the application domain of real-life mobility monitoring that is particularly affected by the challenge mentioned above.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,An Empirical Guide for Visualization Consistency in Multiple Coordinated Views,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Visual analytic systems usually provide multiple coordinated views (MCVs) to support data analysis and exploration. Coordination in visual graphics plays an important role in facilitating comprehensive analytical tasks, such as data comparison and cognitive inference. However, individual views in MCVs are probably designed for a specific purpose based on a particular type of data, and insufficient consideration of the intricate relationships among views may lead to inconsistency in visual representation and user interaction across different views. To better understand the inconsistency issues in MCVs and their impacts on user behaviors, this paper reports a study on the analysis and classification of visualization inconsistency based on the reviews of interactive visualization designs and visual analytic systems, and the interviews with stakeholders. We find that inconsistencies are prevalent in MCVs and frequently lead to misleading or even incorrect results. We classify the discovered inconsistencies based on a coordination model of MCVs, and develop an empirical guide for systematic and efficient visualization consistency checking in the design, implementation, and evaluation stage.",Human-centered computing;Visualization;Empirical studies in visualization

The output of such systems can be used to assemble large networks capturing the understanding of mechanistic pathways and their interactions as represented in the underlying body of research.We describe a system designed to help researchers search, visualize and interact with biological networks derived via information extraction tools. As input, the system takes a dataset of biological and biochemical interactions automatically generated by an information extraction system and provides an interface designed to search, visualize and interact with the data. The usage paradigm consists of identifying a starting point for a search, then using the dataâ€™s network structure by incrementally exploring the immediate neighborhood of the elements displayed by the system.Our system differs from prior work as it leverages both the network structure in the data and the natural language text backing those connections: every connection displayed is traceable back to the documents and phrases in the corpus that support that specific piece of information. We also present two case studies with immunobiology researchers using the system to find previously unknown relationships between biological entities. While the evidence suggesting these relationships already existed, it was scattered across the literature, and existing specialized web databases and domain-search engines could not find it.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Dimensionality Explorer for Single-Cell Analysis,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is becoming popular in studying the gene expression of cells at the single-cell level. ScRNA-seq enables analysts to characterize cell types, thereby providing a better understanding of dynamic biological processes. In scRNA-seq data analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) is commonly used to reduce at least thousands of dimensions in the raw data to a manageable size so that analysts can visualize and cluster cells to identify different cell types. The conventional process to determine the optimal dimensionality includes a laborious manual review of hundreds of different projection plots. To address this problem, we introduce a dimensionality explorer for single-cell analysis, which is a visualization system that helps analysts to effectively determine the optimal dimensionality of scRNA-seq data. It employs a hull heatmap, which provides a holistic view of overlaps among multiple cell types across various dimensionalities using a convex hull-embedded color map. The hull heatmap effectively reduces the burden of manually reviewing hundreds of projection plots to determine the optimal dimensionality. Our system also provides interactive gene expression level visualization and intuitive lasso selection, thereby allowing analysts to progressively refine the convex hulls of the hull heatmap.

VDIs are compact view-dependent volume representations that enable interactive visualization of large volumes at high frame rates by decoupling viewpoint changes from expensive rendering calculations. However, current rendering approaches for VDIs struggle with achieving interactive frame rates at high image resolutions. Here, we exploit the properties of perspective projection to simplify intersections of rays with the view-dependent frustums in a VDI and leverage spatial smoothness in the volume data to minimize memory accesses. Benchmarks show that responsive frame rates can be achieved close to the viewpoint of generation for HD display resolutions, providing high-fidelity approximate renderings of Gigabyte-sized volumes. We also propose a method to subsample the VDI for preview rendering, maintaining high frame rates even for large viewpoint deviations.

Developing comprehensive strategies for disease prevention and control requires professionals to study livestock farms from a variety of data sources, such as veterinary medical tests, financial reports, and animal movements between farms. However, investigating animal health surveillance is challenging as the collected data is often heterogeneous, high-dimensional, and spatio-temporal. Furthermore, data missingness, one common challenge in disease surveillance, can limit the effectiveness of the analysis and induce the misinterpretation of the result due to the lack of uncertainty representation. In this paper, we present a visual analytics interface of coordinated views that supports investigating disease outbreaks by connecting the relationships of livestock farms from different aspects â€” geospatial, transactional, and financial. Coupled with unsupervised machine learning methods, we infer the health status of a farm, despite the absence of its diagnostic history, with uncertainty and provide interpretability to such inferences. With these functionalities, we further quantify the influence of a disease outbreak, severity and scale, guiding the user toward investigating important outbreaks. We demonstrate the analysis capability of our visual analytics interface with multiple use cases on a real-world swine production dataset.",animal health;disease surveillance;visual analytics;machine learning
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,NFTVis: Visual Analysis of NFT Performance,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"A non-fungible token (NFT) is a data unit stored on the blockchain. Nowadays, more and more investors and collectors (NFT traders), who participate in transactions of NFTs, have an urgent need to assess the performance of NFTs. However, there are two challenges for NFT traders when analyzing the performance of NFT. First, the current rarity models have flaws and are sometimes not convincing. In addition, NFT performance is dependent on multiple factors, such as images (high-dimensional data), history transactions (network), and market evolution (time series). It is difficult to take comprehensive consideration and analyze NFT performance efficiently. To address these challenges, we propose NFTVis, a visual analysis system that facilitates assessing individual NFT performance. A new NFT rarity model is proposed to quantify NFTs with images. Four well-coordinated views are designed to represent the various factors affecting the performance of the NFT. Finally, we evaluate the usefulness and effectiveness of our system using two case studies and user studies.",Non-fungible token;Finance visualization;Rarity model
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Interactive Transformations and Visual Assessment of Noisy Event Sequences: An Application in En-Route Air Traffic Control,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Real-world event sequence data, such as activity logs, eye-tracking data, simulation data, and electronic health records, often share characteristics such as a large alphabet of events, fragmentation, noise, and high complexity which makes them difficult to analyze in their raw form. Because of this, simplification and preprocessing through various data transformations are commonly required before the data can be effectively visualized and analyzed. Existing methods for such data transformation are either manually applied and rely heavily on user expertise, or use algorithmic approaches to apply bulk operations which can imply the loss of potentially important information without users being aware. To bridge this gap, we propose a visual analytics approach that aims to successively increase the quality of noisy event sequences by supporting an interactive, context-aware application of data transformations. This is achieved by providing cues concerning the potential loss of information that transformation operations may imply and allowing users to explore, and visually assess their impact on the data. Therefore, a central feature of the approach is that users can tune the data transformation process so that important identified data characteristics are preserved. We motivate the proposed approach in the domain of air traffic control and illustrate it through a usage example, using event sequences derived by merging eye-tracking and simulator data from a human-in-the-loop simulation experiment with 14 air traffic controllers.",Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization application domains;Visual analytics;

Reproducibility is desirable beyond ensuring scientific rigor: In the long-term, it helps advance sustainable visualization research, and in the short-term, it supports domain experts using the visualizations in their daily work. Designing for and ensuring reproducibility introduces costs, such as as storage cost or infrastructure maintenance. We propose a typology of reproducibility aspects that can be considered during visualization design. We then propose practical strategies to improve reproducibility and discuss their initial and running costs, their limits, and their tradeoffs. Finally, we discuss three concrete visualization approaches in the context of our typology and strategies.",Reproducibility;provenance;long-term storage;sustainable visualization

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,How Can We Improve Data Quality for Machine Learning? A Visual Analytics System using Data and Process-driven Strategies,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"ML (Machine learning) models are used to mine inconspicuous information in big data. The model and data quality influence the performance of a machine-learning model. However, it is inefficient to modify the model, which is a black box, and low-quality data tends to cause biased learning of the model. Therefore, it is crucial to improve the data quality. Different techniques have been used to improve data quality depending on the data conditions and the data quality issues. Therefore, improving data quality is time-consuming and challenging for users with insufficient knowledge of data. Visual analytics techniques have been proposed to focus on decision support to improve data quality. However, existing studies are complicated for users to consider a comprehensive DQI (Data Quality Improvement) method for generating data suitable for ML models. Also, it remains limited in that users must directly consider all combinations of DQI processes. This paper presents a novel visual analytics system that manages data quality for use in ML models. The proposed system suggests an optimal quality improvement process with visualization techniques such as heatmap, histogram, and scatter plot to support DQI.",Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization systems and tools
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Feature Learning for Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction toward Maximal Extraction of Hidden Patterns,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Dimensionality reduction (DR) plays a vital role in the visual analysis of high-dimensional data. One main aim of DR is to reveal hidden patterns that lie on intrinsic low-dimensional manifolds. However, DR often overlooks important patterns when the manifolds are distorted or masked by certain influential data attributes. This paper presents a feature learning framework, FEALM, designed to generate a set of optimized data projections for nonlinear DR in order to capture important patterns in the hidden manifolds. These projections produce maximally different nearest-neighbor graphs so that resultant DR outcomes are significantly different. To achieve such a capability, we design an optimization algorithm as well as introduce a new graph dissimilarity measure, named neighbor-shape dissimilarity. Additionally, we develop interactive visualizations to assist comparison of obtained DR results and interpretation of each DR result. We demonstrate FEALMâ€™s effectiveness through experiments and case studies using synthetic and real-world datasets.",Dimensionality reduction;feature learning;network comparison;Nelder-Mead optimization;UMAP;visual analytics
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Neural Stream Functions,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"We present a neural network approach to compute stream functions, which are scalar functions with gradients orthogonal to a given vector field. As a result, isosurfaces of the stream function extract stream surfaces, which can be visualized to analyze flow features. Our approach takes a vector field as input and trains an implicit neural representation to learn a stream function for that vector field. The network learns to map input coordinates to a stream function value by minimizing the inner product of the gradient of the neural networkâ€™s output and the vector field. Since stream function solutions may not be unique, we give optional constraints for the network to learn particular stream functions of interest. Specifically, we introduce regularizing loss functions that can optionally be used to generate stream function solutions whose stream surfaces follow the flow fieldâ€™s curvature, or that can learn a stream function that includes a stream surface passing through a seeding rake. We also discuss considerations for properly visualizing the trained implicit network and extracting artifact-free surfaces. We compare our results with other implicit solutions and present qualitative and quantitative results for several synthetic and simulated vector fields.",Flow Visualization;Implicit Neural Representations;Stream Surface Extraction

In this paper, we conduct interviews with users of business dashboards, in particular, performance dashboards and scorecards, in order to gain an understanding of how they might be used in daily practice. We discuss how dashboards are not only used, as the literature suggests, to gain a quick understanding of the data but are deployed, by making the data available to everyone, as a means of motivating the users through creating a competitive framing of the data. We discuss the implications of this and how our findings can inform and support approaches to dashboard design, implementation, and usage.",data visualization;dashboards;motivation
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,MySemCloud: Semantic-aware Word Cloud Editing,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Word clouds are a popular text visualization technique that summarize an input text by displaying its most important words in a compact image. The traditional layout methods do not take proximity effects between words into account; this has been improved in semantic word clouds, where relative word placement is controlled by edges in a word similarity graph. We introduce MySemCloud, a new human-in-the-loop tool to visualize and edit semantic word clouds. MySemCloud lets users perform computer-assisted local moves of words, which improve or at least retain the semantic quality. To achieve this, we construct a word similarity graph on which a system of forces is applied to generate a compact initial layout with good semantic quality. The force system also allows us to maintain these attributes after each user interaction, as well as preserve the userâ€™s mental map. The tool provides algorithmic support for the editing operations to help the user enhance the semantic quality of the visualization, while adjusting it to their personal preference. We show that MySemCloud provides high user satisfaction as well as permits users to create layouts of higher quality than state-of-the-art semantic word cloud generation tools.",Semantic word cloud;text visualization;human-in-the-loop

The examination of detailed changes in Wikipedia articles is crucial for understanding how authorsâ€™ perspectives vary and conflict during the collaborative editing process. However, it is challenging to reveal the details while preserving the heterogeneous attributes of revisions, namely the time, content, and editor. The Edit-History Vis system integrates editor and textual changes of revisions by utilizing a force-directed revision graph that groups revisions based on standpoints. Through this revision graph, users can identify and analyze editing events such as edit wars, vandalism, repair, and normal updates. The effectiveness of the system in analyzing the edit history is validated through a qualitative comparison with prior work and a quantitative rating from a user study.",Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visual Analytics
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,LabelVizier: Interactive Validation and Relabeling for Technical Text Annotations,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"With the rapid accumulation of text data produced by data-driven techniques, the task of extracting ""data annotations""â€”concise, high-quality data summaries from unstructured raw textâ€”has become increasingly important. The recent advances in weak supervision and crowd-sourcing techniques provide promising solutions to efficiently create annotations (labels) for large-scale technical text data. However, such annotations may fail in practice because of the change in annotation requirements, application scenarios, and modeling goals, where label validation and relabeling by domain experts are required. To approach this issue, we present LabelVizier, a human-in-the-loop workflow that incorporates domain knowledge and user-specific requirements to reveal actionable insights into annotation flaws, then produce better-quality labels for large-scale multi-label datasets. We implement our workflow as an interactive notebook to facilitate flexible error profiling, in-depth annotation validation for three error types, and efficient annotation relabeling on different data scales. We evaluated our workflow in assisting the validation and relabelling of technical text annotation with two use cases and four expert reviews. The results show that LabelVizier is applicable in various application scenarios, and users with different knowledge backgrounds have diverse preferences for the tool usage.",Workflow Design;Technical Language Processing;Data Annotation;Model Interpretation
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,GraphDescriptor: Augmenting Node-Link Diagrams With Textual Descriptions,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Node-link diagrams are the most popular form for graph visualization. Yet, salient information of a node-link diagram cannot be fully depicted by solely presenting the visualization. We propose to augment node-link diagrams by creating textual descriptions for interested information. We conduct an expert review and a user interview to identify six requirements of generated interpretations, including three requirements for connection extraction and three requirements for visual expression. Our solution, GraphDescriptor, generates textual descriptions with two stages: feature extraction and description generation. The first one identifies and extracts features of node-link diagrams, like node connections, visual designs, and types of graph layouts. The second stage creates a group of hierarchical sentences based on a pre-defined schema. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first attempt to generate textual descriptions automatically.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Understanding 3D Data Videos: From Screens to Virtual Reality,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Data storytelling explores how to communicate data insights to the general public engagingly and effectively. It combines the power of data visualizations and storytelling techniques and is popular in various media such as newspapers, interactive websites, and videos. Recently, virtual reality has brought new opportunities to enhance data storytelling with an incomparable sense of immersion. However, there exists a limited understanding of data stories in virtual reality (VR) as they are still in the early stage. In this paper, we investigated the idea of VR data videos by drawing inspiration from popular 3D data videos and studying how to transfer them from screens to VR. We systematically analyzed 100 highly-watched 3D data videos from Youtube and Tiktok channels to derive their design space. We then conducted a user study with 12 participants to explore the effects of four design factors on user experience, including varying camera angles, showing chart overview, animation, and using anchors. Specifically, participants watched 3D data videos in desktop and VR environments. We collected and analyzed their quantitative and qualitative feedback regarding the storyâ€™s understandability, memorability, engagement, and emotional effects. Results suggested that data videos in VR were significantly more appreciated than on desktops. We concluded with design implications for future applications and research on VR data videos.",Narrative Visualization;Data Video;Virtual Reality
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,MetaStackVis: Visually-Assisted Performance Evaluation of Metamodels,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Stacking (or stacked generalization) is an ensemble learning method with one main distinctiveness from the rest: even though several base models are trained on the original data set, their predictions are further used as input data for one or more metamodels arranged in at least one extra layer. Composing a stack of models can produce high-performance outcomes, but it usually involves a trial-and-error process. Therefore, our previously developed visual analytics sys-tem, StackGenVis, was mainly designed to assist users in choosing a set of top-performing and diverse models by measuring their predictive performance. However, it only employs a single logistic regression metamodel. In this paper, we investigate the impact of alternative metamodels on the performance of stacking ensembles using a novel visualization tool, called MetaStackVis. Our interactive tool helps users to visually explore different singular and pairs of metamodels according to their predictive probabilities and multiple validation metrics, as well as their ability to predict specific problematic data instances.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Detecting Critical Points in 2D Scalar Field Ensembles Using Bayesian Inference,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In an era of quickly growing data set sizes, information reduction methods such as extracting or highlighting characteristic features become more and more important for data analysis. For single scalar fields, topological methods can fill this role by extracting and relating critical points. While such methods are regularly employed to study single scalar fields, it is less well studied how they can be extended to uncertain data, as produced, e.g., by ensemble simulations. Motivated by our previous work on visualization in climate research, we study new methods to characterize critical points in ensembles of 2D scalar fields. Previous work on this topic either assumed or required specific distributions, did not account for uncertainty introduced by approximating the underlying latent distributions by a finite number of fields, or did not allow to answer all our domain experts' questions. In this work, we use Bayesian inference to estimate the probability of critical points, either of the original ensemble or its bootstrapped mean. This does not make any assumptions on the underlying distribution and allows to estimate the sensitivity of the results to finite-sample approximations of the underlying distribution. We use color mapping to depict these probabilities and the stability of their estimation. The resulting images can, e.g., be used to estimate how precise the critical points of the mean-field are. We apply our method to synthetic data to validate its theoretical properties and compare it with other methods in this regard. We also apply our method to the data from our previous work, where it provides a more accurate answer to the domain experts' research questions.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Incorporating Texture Information into Dimensionality Reduction for High-Dimensional Images,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"High-dimensional imaging is becoming increasingly relevant in many fields from astronomy and cultural heritage to systems biology. Visual exploration of such high-dimensional data is commonly facilitated by dimensionality reduction. However, common dimensionality reduction methods do not include spatial information present in images, such as local texture features, into the construction of low-dimensional embeddings. Consequently, exploration of such data is typically split into a step focusing on the attribute space followed by a step focusing on spatial information, or vice versa. In this paper, we present a method for incorporating spatial neighborhood information into distance-based dimensionality reduction methods, such as t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). We achieve this by modifying the distance measure between high-dimensional attribute vectors associated with each pixel such that it takes the pixel's spatial neighborhood into account. Based on a classification of different methods for comparing image patches, we explore a number of different approaches. We compare these approaches from a theoretical and experimental point of view. Finally, we illustrate the value of the proposed methods by qualitative and quantitative evaluation on synthetic data and two real-world use cases.",Mathematics of computing-Dimensionality reduction;Human-centered computing-Visualization techniques;Human-centered computing-Visual analytics

For movement on fixed-track networks, traditional scheduling algorithms have dominated so far, but the interest in autonomous and intelligent agents is growing as they promise to react to unexpected and exceptional situations more robustly. In this paper, we study data from the Flatland 2020 NeurIPS Competition, where trains move through a virtual rail network. We developed a timeline-based visualization that provides an overview of all train movements in a simulated episode, clearly hinting at different phases, non-optimal routes, and issues such as deadlocks. This view is complemented with a map view and a graph view, interactively linked through highlighting and synchronous animation. Defining regions of interest in the map builds an analysis graph for detailed inspection. A comparison mode allows contrasting two different episodes regarding the same rail network across all views. We have conducted this application study in close collaboration with the Flatland community. Identified analysis goals stem from interviews with key persons of the community, while the approach itself was developed in two iterations based on feedback from experts with diverse backgrounds.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Scalar2Vec: Translating Scalar Fields to Vector Fields via Deep Learning,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"We introduce Scalar2Vec, a new deep learning solution that translates scalar fields to velocity vector fields for scientific visualization. Given multivariate or ensemble scalar field volumes and their velocity vector field counterparts, Scalar2Vec first identifies suitable variables for scalar-to-vector translation. It then leverages a k-complete bipartite translation network (kCBT-Net) to complete the translation task. kCBT-Net takes a set of sampled scalar volumes of the same variable as input, extracts their multi -scale information, and learns to synthesize the corresponding vector volumes. Ground-truth vector fields and their derived quantities are utilized for loss computation and network training. After training, Scalar2Vec can infer unseen velocity vector fields of the same data set directly from their scalar field counterparts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Scalar2Vec with quantitative and qualitative results on multiple data sets and compare it with three other state-of-the-art deep learning methods.",Scalar field;vector field;scalar-to-vector translation;deep learning
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Boundary-Aware Rectilinear Grid: Accurate Approximation of Unstructured Dataset into Rectilinear Grid with Solid Boundary Handling Capabilities,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Computational fluid dynamics simulations produce increasingly large datasets that are often defined over unstructured grids with solid boundaries. Though unstructured grids allow for the flexible representation of this geometry and the refinement of the grid resolution, they suffer from high storage cost, non-trivial spatial queries, and low reconstruction smoothness. On the other hand, rectilinear grids do not have these drawbacks, but they cannot represent complex boundaries. We present in this paper a technique for the high-quality approximation of large unstructured datasets with solid boundaries onto modified rectilinear grids that we endow with boundary handling capabilities. The resulting data representation can accommodate challenging boundaries while supporting high-order reconstruction kernels with a much-reduced memory footprint. As such, our data representation enjoys all the benefits of conventional rectilinear grids while addressing their fundamental geometric limitations. We demonstrate the proposed approach on several CFD datasets and show that our method achieves an accurate and high-quality approximation of simulation datasets.",Unstructured grid-rectilinear grid-approximation-solid boundary interpolation

Although these metrics can successfully evaluate drawings of large graphs, they are limited to relatively sparse graphs, since existing metrics use planar proximity graphs GG (Gabriel Graph) and RNG (Relative Neighbourhood Graph). This paper presents new shape-based faithfulness metrics for evaluating drawings of large and complex graphs, using high-order prox-imity graphs k-GG and k-RNG. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our new shape-based metrics using degree-based proximity graphs dGG and dRNG can more accurately measure the faithful-ness of drawings of large and complex graphs, with a significant improvement of over 100% better, on average, than the existing shape-based metrics using GG and RNG. Moreover, we present a new shape change faithfulness metric DSC for evaluating drawings of dynamic graphs, by measuring how proportional the geometric shape change in the drawings of dynamic graphs is to the ground truth change in dynamic graphs. Validation using deformation experiments support that DSC can accurately measure shape change faithfulness in dynamic graph drawing. Furthermore, we present extensive comparison experiments of ten popular graph layouts using our new shape-based metrics dGG, dRNG and DSC, to recommend which layouts can give a better shape-faithful graph drawing for large and complex graphs.",Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization design and evaluation methods

IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Virtual Inspection of Additively Manufactured Parts,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Advanced manufacturing techniques, such as additive manufacturing, enable the design of increasingly complex components for a wide range of industrial applications. However, this complexity makes qualification of the parts, determining whether a part is within some margin of error from the initial design, difficult. To inspect and qualify complex internal geometries that are not accessible with an external probe, parts are typically scanned with computed tomography (CT), and manually compared to the computer-aided design (CAD) model using visual inspections. Matching the CAD model to the 3D reconstructed object is challenging in a traditional desktop environment due to the lack of depth perception and 3D interaction. An additional challenge comes from the geometric complexity of CAD meshes and large-scale CT scans. We present a virtual reality (VR) system for manual qualification, providing a novel defect visualization method. First, we describe a semiautomatic CAD-to-Scan Registration approach in VR using a finite element mesh. Second, we introduce the Defect Box, which enables full-resolution inspection for massive scans and CAD-CT comparison of local defect regions. Finally, our system includes intuitive 3D Metrology methods that enable natural interactions for the measurement of features and defects in VR.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,A Tale of Two Centers: Visual Exploration of Health Disparities in Cancer Care,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"The annual incidence of head and neck cancers (HNC) worldwide is more than 550,000 cases, with around 300,000 deaths each year. However, the incidence rates and disease-characteristics of HNC differ between treatment centers and different populations, due to undetermined reasons, which may or not include socioeconomic factors. The multi-faceted and multi-variate nature of the data in the context of the emerging field of health disparities research makes automated analysis impractical. Hence, we present a visual analysis approach to explore the health disparities in the data of HNC patients from two different cohorts at two cancer care centers. Our approach integrates data from multiple sources, including census data and city data, with custom visual encodings and with a nearest neighbor approach. Our design, created in collaboration with oncology experts, makes it possible to analyze the patients' demographic, disease characteristics, treatments and outcomes, and to make significant comparisons of these two cohorts and of individual patients. We evaluate this approach through two case studies performed with domain experts. The results demonstrate that this visual analysis approach successfully accomplishes the goal of comparing two cohorts in terms of different significant factors, and can provide insights into the main source of health disparities between the two centers.",Biomedical and medical visualization;Design studies;Hypothesis forming
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Why? Why not? When? Visual Explanations of Agent Behaviour in Reinforcement Learning,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Reinforcement learning (RL) is used in many domains, including autonomous driving, robotics, stock trading, and video games. Unfortunately, the black box nature of RL agents, combined with legal and ethical considerations, makes it increasingly important that humans (including those are who not experts in RL) understand the reasoning behind the actions taken by an RL agent, particularly in safety-critical domains. To help address this challenge, we introduce PolicyExplainer, a visual analytics interface which lets the user directly query an autonomous agent. PolicyExplainer visualizes the states, policy, and expected future rewards for an agent, and supports asking and answering questions such as: â€œWhy take this action? Why not take this other action? When is this action taken?â€ PolicyExplainer is designed based upon a domain analysis with RL researchers, and is evaluated via qualitative and quantitative assessments on a trio of domains: taxi navigation, a stack bot domain, and drug recommendation for HIV patients. We find that PolicyExplainer's visual approach promotes trust and understanding of agent decisions better than a state-of-the-art text-based explanation approach. Interviews with domain practitioners provide further validation for PolicyExplainer as applied to safety-critical domains. Our results help demonstrate how visualization-based approaches can be leveraged to decode the behavior of autonomous RL agents, particularly for RL non-experts.",Human-centered computing-Visualization-Visualization techniques-Treemaps;Human-centered computing-Visualization-Visualization design and evaluation methods
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,A Study of the Locality of Persistence-Based Queries and Its Implications for the Efficiency of Localized Data Structures,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Scientific datasets are often analyzed and visualized using isosurfaces. The connected components at or above the isovalue defining these isosurfaces are called superlevel-set components. The vertex set of these superlevel-set components can be used to compute local statistics, such as mean temperature or histogram per component, or to segment the data. However, in datasets produced by acquisition devices or simulations, noise induces many spurious components that clutter the visualization and analysis results. Many of these spurious components would disappear if the data values were slightly adjusted. The notion of persistence captures the stability of a component with respect to function value changes, and so we are interested in computing persistence quickly. Locality of computation is critical for parallel scalability, minimization of communication in a distributed environment, or an out-of-core processing. The recently introduced merge forest attained high performance by exploiting locality, thereby avoiding communication until needed to resolve a feature query. We extend the merge forest to support persistence-based queries and study the locality of these queries by evaluating the traversals of regions of data during a query. We confirm that the majority of evaluated datasets have the property that the noise is mostly local, and thus can be efficiently eliminated without performing a global analysis. Finally, we compare the query running times with those of a triplet merge tree because a triplet merge tree answers all proposed queries in constant time and can be constructed from a merge tree in linear time.",Human-centered computing- Visualization- Visu-alization application domains-Scientific visualization
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,News Kaleidoscope: Visual Investigation of Coverage Diversity in News Event Reporting,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"When a newsworthy event occurs, media articles that report on the event can vary widely-a concept known as coverage diversity. To help investigate coverage diversity in event reporting, we de-velop a visual analytics system called News Kaleidoscope. News Kaleidoscope combines several backend language processing techniques with a coordinated visualization interface. Notably, News Kaleidoscope is tailored for visualization non-experts, and adopts an analytic workflow based around subselection analysis, whereby second-level features of articles are extracted to provide a more detailed and nuanced analysis of coverage diversity. To robustly evaluate News Kaleidoscope, we conduct a trio of user studies. (1) A study with news experts assesses the insights promoted for our targeted journalism-savvy users. (2) A follow-up study with news novices assesses the overall system and the specific insights pro-moted for journalism-agnostic users. (3) Based on identified system limitations in these two studies, we refine News Kaleidoscope's design and conduct a third study to validate these improvements. Results indicate that, for both news novice and experts, News Kalei-doscope supports an effective, task-driven workflow for analyzing the diversity of news coverage about events, though journalism expertise has a significant influence on the user's insights and take-aways. Our insights developing and evaluating News Kaleidoscope can aid future tools that combine visualization with natural language processing to analyze coverage diversity in news event reporting.",Human-centered computing-Visualization-Visu-alization techniques-Treemaps;Human-centered computing-Visualization-Visualization design and evaluation methods
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Misinformation has disruptive effects on our lives. Many researchers have looked into means to identify and combat misinformation in text or data visualization. However, there is still a lack of under-standing of how misinformation can be introduced when text and visualization are combined to tell data stories, not to mention how to improve the lay public's awareness of possible misperceptions about facts in narrative visualization. In this paper, we first analyze where misinformation could possibly be injected into the production-consumption process of data stories through a literature survey. Then, as a first step towards combating misinformation in data stories, we explore possible defensive design methods to enhance the reader's awareness of information misalignment when data facts are scripted and visualized. More specifically, we conduct a between-subjects crowdsourcing study to investigate the impact of two design methods enhancing text-visualization integration, i.e., explanatory annotation and interactive linking, on users' awareness of misinformation in data stories. The study results show that although most participants still can not find misinformation, the two design methods can significantly lower the perceived credibility of the text or visualizations. Our work informs the possibility of fighting an infodemic through defensive design methods.",Human-centered computing-Visualization-Visualization design and evaluation methods
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,SET-STAT-MAP: Extending Parallel Sets for Visualizing Mixed Data,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Multi-attribute dataset visualizations are often designed based on attribute types, i.e., whether the attributes are categorical or numerical. Parallel Sets and Parallel Coordinates are two well-known techniques to visualize categorical and numerical data, respectively. A common strategy to visualize mixed data is to use multiple information linked view, e.g., Parallel Coordinates are often augmented with maps to explore spatial data with numeric attributes. In this paper, we design visualizations for mixed data, where the dataset may include numerical, categorical, and spatial attributes. The proposed solution SET-STAT-MAP is a harmonious combination of three interactive components: Parallel Sets (visualizes sets determined by the combination of categories or numeric ranges), statistics columns (visualizes numerical summaries of the sets), and a geospatial map view (visualizes the spatial information). We augment these components with colors and textures to enhance users' capability of analyzing distributions of pairs of attribute combinations. To improve scalability, we merge the sets to limit the number of possible combinations to be rendered on the display. We demonstrate the use of Set-stat-map using two different types of datasets: a meteorological dataset and an online vacation rental dataset (Airbnb). To examine the potential of the system, we collaborated with the meteorologists, which revealed both challenges and opportunities for Set-stat-map to be used for real-life visual analytics.",Human-centered computing- Visualization- Visu-alization techniques;Information Interfaces and Presentation-Miscellaneous
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Evaluating StackGenVis with a Comparative User Study,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Stacked generalization (also called stacking) is an ensemble method in machine learning that deploys a metamodel to summarize the predictive results of heterogeneous base models organized into one or more layers. Despite being capable of producing high-performance results, building a stack of models can be a trial-and-error procedure. Thus, our previously developed visual analytics system, entitled StackGen Vis, was designed to monitor and control the entire stacking process visually. In this work, we present the results of a comparative user study we performed for evaluating the StackGen-Vis system. We divided the study participants into two groups to test the usability and effectiveness of StackGen Vis compared to Orange Visual Stacking (OVS) in an exploratory usage scenario using health-care data. The results indicate that StackGen Vis is significantly more powerful than OVS based on the qualitative feedback provided by the participants.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Hierarchical Multifocus Navigation in Text Annotation Data,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"We present a new hierarchical multifocus representation- and interaction-technique for the analysis of text annotations. The comparative analysis of annotation data on multiple, distant passages (focus regions) of a long source text raises several scalability problems. In particular, one soon can be confronted with many nested foci on text ranges with sizes of different orders of magnitude. Our solution suggests to delegate the detailed data representation to other views and to concentrate in the presented overview on the organization of the focus regions. The approach consists of three parts: a collection of strips where the annotations are represented in a condensed form and where sibling- and child-foci are manipulated, a map of the resulting tree of foci for direct access, and a work bench that allows to compare deliberate nodes of the tree on a flat layer. We discuss our approach by comparing it with other state-of-the-art multifocus techniques and describe two use cases that deal with relational annotation and with the analysis of annotations on hierarchical text structures respectively.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Visualization for neural-network-based person re-identification,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Given images of a person, person re- identification (Person ReID) techniques aim to find images of the same person from previously collected images. Because of large data sets of person images and the advance of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) successfully boost the accuracy of Person ReID algorithms, but it can be difficult to explain and to troubleshoot issues due to the complexity of CNNs. In this paper, we present a visualization-based approach to understand a CNN-based Person ReID algorithm. As Person ReID algorithms are often designed to map images of the same person into similar feature vectors, given two images, we design an algorithm to estimate how much each element in a CNN layer contributes to the similarity between their feature vectors. Based on the estimation, we build a visualization tool to interactively locate and visualize the activation of highly-contributing elements, other than manually examining all. Our visualization tool also supports various user interaction widgets to explore a Person ReID data set, locate difficult cases, and analyze the reason behind their similarities. We show a use case with our tool to understand and troubleshoot issues in a CNN-based Person ReID algorithm.",convolutional-neural-networks;person-reidentification;visualization

This study explores an affect-centered narrative to convey data-driven messages regarding contact tracing apps (CTAs) using video as a medium (i.e., data video). A between-subjects online study compared the effect of three storytelling approaches on viewers' perception. A video developed by Google was selected as the baseline video (Control Condition; 2min 23s) due to its high quality and relevance to CTAs. The central messages of this baseline video were; a) how CTAs work, and b) how safe and effective CTAs are. Infographics supporting these messages were then added to the baseline video (the second condition; 3min 19s); this was a simple data video (DV), and it did not intend to induce specific emotional experiences in participants (i.e., cognition-centered video). Finally, an affect-focused DV (AFDV) was also created by emphasizing the emotion-based narrative aspect of the message (the third condition; 4min 6s). In this video, three cute human-like cartoon characters were introduced. Viewers in this condition needed to process both cognitive and affective information. Note all three videos (i.e., control video, DV, and AFDV) conveyed identical messages. Participants watched one of these three videos only once, and we explored the video effect on their perception. Our results repeatedly indicated the potential benefits of including affect in data storytelling.",Data-Video;Persuasion;Affect-Driven-Data-Storytelling

Our system helps users to readily detect and filter noisy parallel corpora by (1) aiding the quality estimation of individual sentence pairs within the corpora by providing diverse quality metrics (e.g., cosine similarity, BLEU, length ratio) and (2) allowing users to visually examine and manage the corpora based on the pre-computed metrics scores.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,Visual Analytics of Multiple Network Ranking Based on Structural Similarity,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Ranking the node importance in complex networks has been widely applied for different purposes, such as web search, resource allocation, and network security. However, existing node ranking methods are almost single network ranking using only one relationship, or aggregate the node ranking scores on multiple networks with equal weight, which are insufficient to construct reasonable multiple network rankings, since the association information among multiple networks is largely ignored. Thus, we propose a multiple network visualization framework by fusing multiple networks to obtain credible node ranking scores. After measuring the scores of nodes in each single network by the classic PageRank, a network weight self-adjustment model based on structural similarities between pair-wise networks is designed to strengthen the common features of multiple networks or their distinct characteristics. Then, a combined score for each node is computed by a weighted sum of its individual ranking scores on multiple networks. Besides, we provide a set of visualization and interaction interfaces, enabling users to intuitively explore, optimize and compare the multiple network rankings. Case studies on real datasets show that our system is flexible to adapt to different application scenarios, and users can successfully solve multiple network ranking tasks efficiently.",Multiple networks;node ranking;visualization;structural similarity

However, it is very difficult to find suitable alternatives materials in traditional ways for its incredible high cost in searching. Machine learning (ML) based methods are currently introduced and used for material prediction. But there is rarely an assisting learning tools designed for domain experts for institutive performance comparison and analysis of ML model. In this case, we propose an interactive visualization system for experts to select suitable ML models, understand and explore the predication results comprehensively.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,A Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Human Preference for Graph Layouts,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Understanding what graph layout human prefer and why they prefer such graph layout is significant and challenging due to the highly complex visual perception and cognition system in human brain. In this paper, we present the first machine learning approach for predicting human preference for graph layouts.In general, the data sets with human preference labels are limited and insufficient for training deep networks. To address this, we train our deep learning model by employing the transfer learning method, e.g., exploiting the quality metrics, such as shape-based metrics, edge crossing and stress, which are shown to be correlated to human preference on graph layouts. Experimental results using the ground truth human preference data sets show that our model can successfully predict human preference for graph layouts. To our best knowledge, this is the first approach for predicting qualitative evaluation of graph layouts using human preference experiment data.",

IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,Automatic Generation of Unit Visualization-based Scrollytelling for Impromptu Data Facts Delivery,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Data-driven scrollytelling has become a prevalent way of visual communication because of its comprehensive delivery of perspectives derived from the data. However, creating an expressive scrollytelling story requires both data and design literacy and is time-consuming. As a result, scrollytelling has been mainly used only by professional journalists to disseminate opinions. In this paper, we present an automatic method to generate expressive scrollytelling visualization, which can present easy-to-understand data facts through a carefully arranged sequence of views. The method first enumerates data facts of a given dataset, and scores and organizes them. The facts are further assembled, sequenced into a story, with reader input taken into consideration. Finally, visual graphs, transitions, and text descriptions are generated to synthesize the scrollytelling visualization. In this way, non-professionals can easily explore and share interesting perspectives from selected data attributes and fact types.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,Parsing and Summarizing Infographics with Synthetically Trained Icon Detection,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Widely used in news, business, and educational media, infographics are handcrafted to effectively communicate messages about complex and often abstract topics including `ways to conserve the environment' and `coronavirus prevention'. The computational understanding of infographics required for future applications like automatic captioning, summarization, search, and question-answering, will depend on being able to parse the visual and textual elements contained within. However, being composed of stylistically and semantically diverse visual and textual elements, infographics pose challenges for current A.I. systems. While automatic text extraction works reasonably well on infographics, standard object detection algorithms fail to identify the stand-alone visual elements in infographics that we refer to as `icons'. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to train an object detector using synthetically-generated data, and show that it succeeds at generalizing to detecting icons within in-the-wild infographics. We further pair our icon detection approach with an icon classifier and a state-of-the-art text detector to demonstrate three demo applications: topic prediction, multi-modal summarization, and multi-modal search.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,Visualising Temporal Uncertainty: A Taxonomy and Call for Systematic Evaluation,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Increased reliance on data in decision-making has highlighted the importance of conveying uncertainty in data visualisations. Yet developing visualisation techniques that clearly and accurately convey uncertainty in data is an open challenge across a variety of fields. This is especially the case when visualising temporal uncertainty. To facilitate the development of innovative and accessible temporal uncertainty visualisation techniques and respond to an identified gap in the literature, we propose the first-ever survey of over 50 temporal uncertainty visualisation techniques deployed in numerous fields. Our paper offers two contributions. First, we propose a novel taxonomy to be applied when classifying temporal uncertainty visualisation techniques. This takes into account the visualisation's intended audience, as well as its level of discreteness in representing uncertainty. Second, we urge researchers and practitioners to use a greater variety of visualisations which differ in terms of their discreteness. In doing so, we believe that a more robust evaluation of visualisation techniques can be achieved.",Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization techniques;Uncertainty
IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,An Extension of Empirical Orthogonal Functions for the Analysis of Time-Dependent 2D Scalar Field Ensembles,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"To assess the reliability of weather forecasts and climate simulations, common practice is to generate large ensembles of numerical simulations. Analyzing such data is challenging and requires pattern and feature detection. For single time-dependent scalar fields, empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) are a proven means to identify the main variation. In this paper, we present an extension of that concept to time-dependent ensemble data.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,NetScatter: Visual analytics of multivariate time series with a hybrid of dynamic and static variable relationships,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"The ability to capture common characteristics among complex multi-variate time series variables can profoundly impact big data analytics in uncovering valuable insights into the relationships among them and enabling a dimensionality reduction technique. Two widely used data displays include time series and scatter plots. While the former focuses on the dynamics over time, the latter deals with static relationships among variables. Motivated by these distinctive perspectives, our research aims to maximally utilize the information captured by both at the same time. This paper presents NetScatter, a visual analytic approach to characterizing changes of pairwise relationships in a high-dimensional time series. Unlike most traditional techniques that employ a single perspective of the visual display, our approach combines static perspectives of two variables in multi-variate time series into a single representation by comparing all data instances over two different time steps. The paper also introduces a list of visual features of the representation to capture how overall data evolve. We have implemented a web-based prototype that supports a full range of operations, such as ranking, filtering, and details on demand.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,Stable Visual Summaries for Trajectory Collections,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"The availability of devices that track moving objects has led to an explosive growth in trajectory data. When exploring the resulting large trajectory collections, visual summaries are a useful tool to identify time intervals of interest. A typical approach is to represent the spatial positions of the tracked objects at each time step via a one-dimensional ordering; visualizations of such orderings can then be placed in temporal order along a time line. There are two main criteria to assess the quality of the resulting visual summary: spatial quality â€“ how well does the ordering capture the structure of the data at each time step, and stability â€“ how coherent are the orderings over consecutive time steps or temporal ranges?In this paper we introduce a new Stable Principal Component (SPC) method to compute such orderings, which is explicitly parameterized for stability, allowing a trade-off between the spatial quality and stability. We conduct extensive computational experiments that quantitatively compare the orderings produced by ours and other stable dimensionality-reduction methods to various state-of-the-art approaches using a set of well-established quality metrics that capture spatial quality and stability. We conclude that stable dimensionality reduction outperforms existing methods on stability, without sacrificing spatial quality or efficiency; in particular, our new SPC method does so at a fraction of the computational costs.",Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization techniques;Mathematics of computing;Probability and statistics;Statistical paradigms;Dimensionality reduction
IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,Visual Analysis of Spatio-Temporal Trends in Time-Dependent Ensemble Data Sets on the Example of the North Atlantic Oscillation,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"A driving factor of the winter weather in Western Europe is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), manifested by fluctuations in the difference of sea level pressure between the Icelandic Low and the Azores High. Different methods have been developed that describe the strength of this oscillation, but they rely on certain assumptions, e.g., fixed positions of these two pressure systems. It is possible that climate change affects the mean location of both the Low and the High and thus the validity of these descriptive methods. This study is the first to visually analyze large ensemble climate change simulations (the MPI Grand Ensemble) to robustly assess shifts of the drivers of the NAO phenomenon using the uncertain northern hemispheric surface pressure fields. For this, we use a sliding window approach and compute empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) for each window and ensemble member, then compare the uncertainty of local extrema in the results as well as their temporal evolution across different CO2 scenarios. We find systematic northeastward shifts in the location of the pressure systems that correlate with the simulated warming.

We visualize these biclusters in a 2D layout to support interactive visual exploration of the analyzed search results, which highlights a novel way of organizing entities of biclusters. We evaluated our approach using a large academic publication corpus, by testing the distribution of the relevant documents and of lead and prolific authors. The results indicate the effectiveness of our approach compared to traditional 1D ranked lists.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,Context-Responsive Labeling in Augmented Reality,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Route planning and navigation are common tasks that often require additional information on points of interest. Augmented Reality (AR) enables mobile users to utilize text labels, in order to provide a composite view associated with additional information in a real-world environment. Nonetheless, displaying all labels for points of interest on a mobile device will lead to unwanted overlaps between information, and thus a context-responsive strategy to properly arrange labels is expected. The technique should remove overlaps, show the right level-of-detail, and maintain label coherence. This is necessary as the viewing angle in an AR system may change rapidly due to usersâ€™ behaviors. Coherence plays an essential role in retaining user experience and knowledge, as well as avoiding motion sickness. In this paper, we develop an approach that systematically manages label visibility and levels-of-detail, as well as eliminates unexpected incoherent movement. We introduce three label management strategies, including (1) occlusion management, (2) level-of-detail management, and (3) coherence management by balancing the usage of the mobile phone screen. A greedy approach is developed for fast occlusion handling in AR. A level-of-detail scheme is adopted to arrange various types of labels. A 3D scene manipulation is then built to simultaneously suppress the incoherent behaviors induced by viewing angle changes. Finally, we present the feasibility and applicability of our approach through one synthetic and two real-world scenarios, followed by a qualitative user study.",Human-centered computing;Visualization

IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,FiberStars: Visual Comparison of Diffusion Tractography Data between Multiple Subjects,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Tractography from high-dimensional diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data allows brainâ€™s structural connectivity analysis. Recent dMRI studies aim to compare connectivity patterns across subject groups and disease populations to understand subtle abnormalities in the brainâ€™s white matter connectivity and distributions of biologically sensitive dMRI derived metrics. Existing software products focus solely on the anatomy, are not intuitive or restrict the comparison of multiple subjects. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of FiberStars, a visual analysis tool for tractography data that allows the interactive visualization of brain fiber clusters combining existing 3D anatomy with compact 2D visualizations. With FiberStars, researchers can analyze and compare multiple subjects in large collections of brain fibers using different views. To evaluate the usability of our software, we performed a quantitative user study. We asked domain experts and non-experts to find patterns in a tractography dataset with either FiberStars or an existing dMRI exploration tool. Our results show that participants using FiberStars can navigate extensive collections of tractography faster and more accurately.

Such graphs can be utilized to model a broad variety of problems in a multitude of domains. Re-searchers from different fields of expertise are increasingly applying graph visualization and analysis to explore unknown phenomena, complex emerging structures, and changes occurring over time in their data. While several empirical studies evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of different network representations, visualizing the temporal dimension in graphs still presents an open challenge. In this paper we propose an exploratory user study with the aim of evaluating different combinations of graph representations, namely node-link and adjacency matrix, and temporal encodings, such as superimposition, juxtaposition and animation, on typical temporal tasks. The study participants expressed positive feedback toward matrix representations, with generally quicker and more accurate responses than with the node-link representation.",Human-centered computing;Visualization;Empirical studies in visualization

However, even browsing an academic database and choosing must-read items can be daunting for novice researchers. In this paper, we introduce Papers101, an interactive system that supports novice researchers' discovery of papers relevant to their research topics. Prior to system design, we performed a formative study to investigate what difficul-ties novice researchers often face and how experienced researchers address them. We found that novice researchers have difficulty in identifying appropriate search terms, choosing which papers to read first, and ensuring whether they have examined enough candidates. In this work, we identified key requirements for the system dedicated to novices: prioritizing search results, unifying the contexts of multiple search results, and refining and validating the search queries. Accordingly, Papers101 provides an opinionated perspective on selecting important metadata among papers. It also visualizes how the priority among papers is developed along with the users' knowledge discovery process.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,Investigating the Evolution of Tree Boosting Models with Visual Analytics,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Tree boosting models are widely adopted predictive models and have demonstrated superior performance than other conventional and even deep learning models, especially since the recent release of their parallel and distributed implementations, e.g., XGBoost, LightGMB, and CatBoost. Tree boosting uses a group of sequentially generated weak learners (i.e., decision trees), each learns from the mistakes of its predecessor, to push the modelâ€™s decision boundary towards the true boundary. As the number of trees keeps increasing over training, it is important to reveal how the newly-added trees change the predictions of individual data instances, and how the impacts of different data features evolve. To accomplish these goals, in this paper, we introduce a new design of the temporal confusion matrix, providing users with an effective interface to track data instancesâ€™ predictions across the tree boosting process. Also, we present an improved visualization to better illustrate and compare the impacts of individual data features (based on their SHAP values) across training iterations. Integrating these components with a tree structure visualization component, we propose a visual analytics system for tree boosting models. Through case studies with domain experts using real-world datasets, we validated the systemâ€™s effectiveness.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,A Visual Analytics Approach for the Diagnosis of Heterogeneous and Multidimensional Machine Maintenance Data,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Analysis of large, high-dimensional, and heterogeneous datasets is challenging as no one technique is suitable for visualizing and clustering such data in order to make sense of the underlying information. For instance, heterogeneous logs detailing machine repair and maintenance in an organization often need to be analyzed to diagnose errors and identify abnormal patterns, formalize root-cause analyses, and plan preventive maintenance. Such real-world datasets are also beset by issues such as inconsistent and/or missing entries. To conduct an effective diagnosis, it is important to extract and understand patterns from the data with support from analytic algorithms (e.g., finding that certain kinds of machine complaints occur more in the summer) while involving the human-in-the-loop. To address these challenges, we adopt existing techniques for dimensionality reduction (DR) and clustering of numerical, categorical, and text data dimensions, and introduce a visual analytics approach that uses multiple coordinated views to connect DR + clustering results across each kind of the data dimension stated. To help analysts label the clusters, each clustering view is supplemented with techniques and visualizations that contrast a cluster of interest with the rest of the dataset. Our approach assists analysts to make sense of machine maintenance logs and their errors. Then the gained insights help them carry out preventive maintenance. We illustrate and evaluate our approach through use cases and expert studies respectively, and discuss generalization of the approach to other heterogeneous data.",Visual analytics;heterogeneous data;high-dimensional data;machine learning;text analytics;maintenance logs
IEEE,conferencePaper,2021,KeywordMap: Attention-based Visual Exploration for Keyword Analysis,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"With the high growth rate of text data, extracting meaningful information from a large corpus becomes increasingly difficult. Keyword extraction and analysis is a common approach to tackle the problem, but it is non-trivial to identify important words in the text and represent the multifaceted properties of those words effectively. Traditional topic modeling based keyword analysis algorithms require hyper-parameters which are often difficult to tune without enough prior knowledge. In addition, the relationships among the keywords are often difficult to obtain. In this paper, we utilize the attention scores extracted from Transformer-based language models to capture word relationships. We propose a domain-driven attention tuning method, guiding the attention to learn domain-specific word relationships. From the attention, we build a keyword network and propose a novel algorithm, Attention-based Word Influence (AWI), to compute how influential each word is in the network. An interactive visual analytics system, KeywordMap, is developed to support multi-level analysis of keywords and keyword relationships through coordinated views. We measure the quality of keywords captured by our AWI algorithm quantitatively. We also evaluate the usefulness and effectiveness of KeywordMap through case studies.",Text/Document Data;Machine Learning;Task and Requirements Analysis

We employ a novel text visualization technique, called semantic preserving word bubbles, to visualize words at a certain time.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,Quality Metrics for Symmetric Graph Drawings,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In this paper, we present a framework for quality metrics that measure symmetry, that is, how faithfully a drawing of a graph displays the ground truth geometric automorphisms as symmetries. The quality metrics are based on group theory as well as geometry. More specifically, we introduce two types of symmetry quality metrics for displaying: (1) a single geometric automorphism as a symmetry (axial or rotational) and (2) a group of geometric automorphisms (cyclic or dihedral). We also present algorithms to compute the symmetry quality metrics in O(n log n) time. We validate our symmetry quality metrics using deformation experiments. We then use the metrics to evaluate existing graph layouts to compare how faithfully they display geometric automorphisms of a graph as symmetries.",Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization techniques;Graph drawing;Visualization design and evaluation methods
IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,BatchLayout: A Batch-Parallel Force-Directed Graph Layout Algorithm in Shared Memory,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Force-directed algorithms are widely used to generate aesthetically-pleasing layouts of graphs or networks arisen in many scientific disciplines. To visualize large-scale graphs, several parallel algorithms have been discussed in the literature. However, existing parallel algorithms do not utilize memory hierarchy efficiently and often offer limited parallelism. This paper addresses these limitations with BatchLayout, an algorithm that groups vertices into minibatches and processes them in parallel. BatchLayout also employs cache blocking techniques to utilize memory hierarchy efficiently. More parallelism and improved memory accesses coupled with force approximating techniques, better initialization, and optimized learning rate make BatchLayout significantly faster than other state-of-the-art algorithms such as ForceAtlas2 and OpenOrd. The visualization quality of layouts from BatchLayout is comparable or better than similar visualization tools.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,ExplainExplore: Visual Exploration of Machine Learning Explanations,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Machine learning models often exhibit complex behavior that is difficult to understand. Recent research in explainable AI has produced promising techniques to explain the inner workings of such models using feature contribution vectors. These vectors are helpful in a wide variety of applications. However, there are many parameters involved in this process and determining which settings are best is difficult due to the subjective nature of evaluating interpretability. To this end, we introduce EXPLAINEXPLORE: an interactive explanation system to explore explanations that fit the subjective preference of data scientists.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,DynamicsExplorer: Visual Analytics for Robot Control Tasks involving Dynamics and LSTM-based Control Policies,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Deep reinforcement learning (RL), where a policy represented by a deep neural network is trained, has shown some success in playing video games and chess. However, applying RL to real-world tasks like robot control is still challenging. Because generating a massive number of samples to train control policies using RL on real robots is very expensive, hence impractical, it is common to train in simulations, and then transfer to real environments. The trained policy, however, may fail in the real world because of the difference between the training and the real environments, especially the difference in dynamics. To diagnose the problems, it is crucial for experts to understand (1) how the trained policy behaves under different dynamics settings, (2) which part of the policy affects the behaviors the most when the dynamics setting changes, and (3) how to adjust the training procedure to make the policy robust.This paper presents DynamicsExplorer, a visual analytics tool to diagnose the trained policy on robot control tasks under different dynamics settings. DynamicsExplorer allows experts to overview the results of multiple tests with different dynamics-related parameter settings so experts can visually detect failures and analyze the sensitivity of different parameters. Experts can further examine the internal activations of the policy for selected tests and compare the activations between success and failure tests. Such comparisons help experts form hypotheses about the policy and allows them to verify the hypotheses via DynamicsExplorer. Multiple use cases are presented to demonstrate the utility of DynamicsExplorer.",

IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,SCANViz: Interpreting the Symbol-Concept Association Captured by Deep Neural Networks through Visual Analytics,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Two fundamental problems in machine learning are recognition and generation. Apart from the tremendous amount of research efforts devoted to these two problems individually, finding the association between them has attracted increasingly more attention recently. Symbol-Concept Association Network (SCAN) is one of the most popular models for this problem proposed by Google DeepMind lately, which integrates an unsupervised concept abstraction process and a supervised symbol-concept association process. Despite the outstanding performance of this deep neural network, interpreting and evaluating it remain challenging. Guided by the practical needs from deep learning experts, this paper proposes a visual analytics attempt, i.e., SCANViz, to address this challenge in the visual domain. Specifically, SCANViz evaluates the performance of SCAN through its power of recognition and generation, facilitates the exploration of the latent space derived from both the unsupervised extraction and supervised association processes, empowers interactive training of SCAN to interpret the modelâ€™s understanding on a particular visual concept. Through concrete case studies with multiple deep learning experts, we validate the effectiveness of SCANViz.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,Visual Interpretation of Recurrent Neural Network on Multi-dimensional Time-series Forecast,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Recent attempts at utilizing visual analytics to interpret Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) mainly focus on natural language processing (NLP) tasks that take symbolic sequences as input. However, many real-world problems like environment pollution forecasting apply RNNs on sequences of multi-dimensional data where each dimension represents an individual feature with semantic meaning such as PM2.5 and SO2. RNN interpretation on multi-dimensional sequences is challenging as users need to analyze what features are important at different time steps to better understand model behavior and gain trust in prediction. This requires effective and scalable visualization methods to reveal the complex many-to-many relations between hidden units and features. In this work, we propose a visual analytics system to interpret RNNs on multi-dimensional time-series forecasts. Specifically, to provide an overview to reveal the model mechanism, we propose a technique to estimate the hidden unit response by measuring how different feature selections affect the hidden unit output distribution. We then cluster the hidden units and features based on the response embedding vectors. Finally, we propose a visual analytics system which allows users to visually explore the model behavior from the global and individual levels.

SSR-VFD is the first work that advocates a machine learning approach to generate high-resolution vector fields from low-resolution ones. The core of SSR-VFD lies in the use of three separate neural nets that take the three components of a low-resolution vector field as input and jointly output a synthesized high-resolution vector field. To capture spatial coherence, we take into account magnitude and angle losses in network optimization. Our method can work in the in situ scenario where VFD are down-sampled at simulation time for storage saving and these reduced VFD are upsampled back to their original resolution during postprocessing. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SSR-VFD, we show quantitative and qualitative results with several vector field data sets of different characteristics and compare our method against volume upscaling using bicubic interpolation, and two solutions based on CNN and GAN, respectively.",Spatial super-resolution;vector field data;convolutional neural network;deep learning

Specifically, we explore the preservation of critical points in piecewise linear vector fields. We define the preservation of critical points as, without any false positive, false negative, or false type change in the decompressed data, (1) keeping each critical point in its original cell and (2) retaining the type of each critical point (e.g., saddle and attracting node). The key to our method is to adapt a vertex-wise error bound for each grid point and to compress input data together with the error bound field using a modified lossy compressor. Our compression algorithm can be also embarrassingly parallelized for large data handling and in situ processing. We benchmark our method by comparing it with existing lossy compressors in terms of false positive/negative/type rates, compression ratio, and various vector field visualizations with several scientific applications.",lossy compression;critical points;vector field visualization

IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,Visualization of Unsteady Flow Using Heat Kernel Signatures,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"We introduce a new technique to visualize complex flowing phenomena by using concepts from shape analysis. Our approach uses techniques that examine the intrinsic geometry of manifolds through their heat kernel, to obtain representations of such manifolds that are isometry-invariant and multi-scale. These representations permit us to compute heat kernel signatures of each point on that manifold, and we can use these signatures as features for classification and segmentation that identify points that have similar structural properties. Our approach adapts heat kernel signatures to unsteady flows by formulating a notion of shape where pathlines are observations of a manifold living in a high-dimensional space. We use this space to compute and visualize heat kernel signatures associated with each pathline. Besides being able to capture the structural features of a pathline, heat kernel signatures allow the comparison of pathlines from different flow datasets through a shape matching pipeline. We demonstrate the analytic power of heat kernel signatures by comparing both (1) different timesteps from the same unsteady flow as well as (2) flow datasets taken from ensemble simulations with varying simulation parameters. Our analysis only requires the pathlines themselves, and thus it does not utilize the underlying vector field directly. We make minimal assumptions on the pathlines: while we assume they are sampled from a continuous, unsteady flow, our computations can tolerate pathlines that have varying density and potential unknown boundaries. We evaluate our approach through visualizations of a variety of two-dimensional unsteady flows.",Flow Visualization;Pathlines;Shape Analysis;Heat Kernel Signatures;Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization application domains;Scientific visualization

IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,Uncertainty Treemaps,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Rectangular treemaps visualize hierarchical numerical data by recursively partitioning an input rectangle into smaller rectangles whose areas match the data. Numerical data often has uncertainty associated with it. To visualize uncertainty in a rectangular treemap, we identify two conflicting key requirements: (i) to assess the data value of a node in the hierarchy, the area of its rectangle should directly match its data value, and (ii) to facilitate comparison between data and uncertainty, uncertainty should be encoded using the same visual variable as the data, that is, area. We present Uncertainty Treemaps, which meet both requirements simultaneously by introducing the concept of hierarchical uncertainty masks. First, we define a new cost function that measures the quality of Uncertainty Treemaps. Then, we show how to adapt existing treemapping algorithms to support uncertainty masks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness and quality of our technique through an expert review and a computational experiment on real-world datasets.",Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization techniques;Treemaps

We implemented an algorithm that is capable of producing more space-reclaiming icicle plot variants. Several visual parameters can be tweaked to change the visual appearance and readability of the plots: among others, a space-reclaiming parameter, an empty space shrinking parameter, and a gap size. To illustrate the usefulness of the novel visualization technique we applied it, among others, to an NCBI taxonomy dataset consisting of more than 300,000 elements and with maximum depth 42.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,PansyTree: Merging Multiple Hierarchies,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Hierarchical structures are very common in the real world for recording all kinds of relational data generated in our daily life and business procedures. A very popular visualization method for displaying such data structures is called ""Tree"". So far, there are a variety of Tree visualization methods that have been proposed and most of them can only visualize one hierarchical dataset at a time. Hence, it raises the difficulty of comparison between two or more hierarchical datasets.In this paper, we proposed Pansy Tree which used a tree metaphor to visualize merged hierarchies. We design a unique icon named pansy to represent each merged node in the structure. Each Pansy is encoded by three colors mapping data items from three different datasets in the same hierarchical position (or tree node). The petals and sepal on Pansy are designed for showing each attributeâ€™s values and hierarchical information. We also redefine the links in force layout encoded by width and animation to better convey hierarchical information. We further apply Pansy Tree into CNCEE datasets and demonstrate two use cases to verify its effectiveness.The main contribution of this work is to merge three datasets into one tree that makes it much easier to explore and compare the structures, data items and data attributes with visual tools.",Tree visualization;merging hierarchies;comparison;nature metaphor.
IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,Efficient Morphing of Shape-preserving Star Coordinates,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Data tours follow an exploratory multi-dimensional data visualization concept that provides animations of projections of the multidimensional data to a 2D visual space. To create an animation, a sequence of key projections is provided and morphings between each pair of consecutive key projections are computed, which then can be stitched together to form the data tour. The morphings should be smooth so that a user can easily follow the transformations, and their computations shall be fast to allow for their integration into an interactive visual exploration process. Moreover, if the key projections are chosen to satisfy additional conditions, it is desirable that these conditions are maintained during morphing. Shape preservation is such a desirable condition, as it avoids shape distortions that may otherwise be caused by a projection. We develop a novel efficient morphing algorithms for computing shape-preserving data tours, i.e., data tours constructed for a sequence of shape-preserving linear projections. We propose a stepping strategy for the morphing to avoid discontinuities in the evolution of the projections, where we represent the linear projections using a star-coordinates system. Our algorithms are less computationally involved, produce smoother morphings, and require less user-defined parameter settings than existing state-of-the-art approaches.",Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization techniques
IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,Leveraging Peer Feedback to Improve Visualization Education,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Peer review is a widely utilized pedagogical feedback mechanism for engaging students, which has been shown to improve educational outcomes. However, we find limited discussion and empirical measurement of peer review in visualization coursework. In addition to engagement, peer review provides direct and diverse feedback and reinforces recently-learned course concepts through critical evaluation of othersâ€™ work. In this paper, we discuss the construction and application of peer review in a computer science visualization course, including: projects that reuse code and visualizations in a feedback-guided, continual improvement process and a peer review rubric to reinforce key course concepts. To measure the effectiveness of the approach, we evaluate student projects, peer review text, and a post-course questionnaire from 3 semesters of mixed undergraduate and graduate courses. The results indicate that course concepts are reinforced with peer reviewâ€”82% reported learning more because of peer review, and 75% of students recommended continuing it. Finally, we provide a road-map for adapting peer review to other visualization courses to produce more highly engaged students.",Human-centered computing;Visualization theory;concepts and paradigms;Visualization;Visualization design;evaluation methods
IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,Representing Multivariate Data by Optimal Colors to Uncover Events of Interest in Time Series Data,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In this paper, we present a visualization system for users to study multivariate time series data. They first identify trends or anomalies from a global view and then examine details in a local view. Specifically, we train a neural network to project high-dimensional data to a two dimensional (2D) planar space while retaining global data distances. By aligning the 2D points with a predefined color map, high-dimensional data can be represented by colors. Because perceptual color differentiation may fail to reflect data distance, we optimize perceptual color differentiation on each map region by deformation. The region with large perceptual color differentiation will expand, whereas the region with small differentiation will shrink. Since colors do not occupy any space in visualization, we convey the overview of multivariate time series data by a calendar view. Cells in the view are color-coded to represent multivariate data at different time spans. Users can observe color changes over time to identify events of interest. Afterward, they study details of an event by examining parallel coordinate plots. Cells in the calendar view and the parallel coordinate plots are dynamically linked for users to obtain insights that are barely noticeable in large datasets. The experiment results, comparisons, conducted case studies, and the user study indicate that our visualization system is feasible and effective.",

But in a highly immersive virtual environment, traditional single-channel precise interactive methods cannot be applied directly to the immersive environment. Inspired by how users typically interact with everyday objects, a novel non-contact gesture interaction method base on What You See is What You Get(WYSIWYG)for volume rendering results is proposed in this paper. Just likes grab interaction in real scene, a full set of tools have been developed to enable direct volume rendering manipulation of color, saturation, contrast, brightness, and other optical properties by gestural motions in our method. Simultaneously, in order to improve the interactive experience in immersive environment, the evaluation model of motion comfort is introduced to design the interactive hand gestures, the cursor model is defined to estimating the gesture state combined with context gestural motions. Finally, the test platform is established with Oculus Rift + Leap Motion to verify the functionality and effectiveness of our method in improving the visual cognitive ability for volume visualization.",WYSIWYG;immersive volume visualization;noncontact gesture interaction;Oculus Rift + Leap Motion;Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization application domains;Scientific visualization
IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,Distribution-based Particle Data Reduction for In-situ Analysis and Visualization of Large-scale N-body Cosmological Simulations,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Cosmological N-body simulation is an important tool for scientists to study the evolution of the universe. With the increase of computing power, billions of particles of high space-time fidelity can be simulated by supercomputers. However, limited computer storage can only hold a small subset of the simulation output for analysis, which makes the understanding of the underlying cosmological phenomena difficult. To alleviate the problem, we design an in-situ data reduction method for large-scale unstructured particle data. During the data generation phase, we use a combined k-dimensional partitioning and Gaussian mixture model approach to reduce the data by utilizing probability distributions. We offer a model evaluation criterion to examine the quality of the probabilistic distribution models, which allows us to identify and improve low-quality models. After the in-situ processing, the particle data size is greatly reduced, which satisfies the requirements from the domain experts. By comparing the astronomical attributes and visualizations of the reconstructed data with the raw data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our in-situ particle data reduction technique.",Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization application domains;Scientific visualization

In these situations, it can be helpful for decision makers to model and visually compare their preferences in order to better understand each othersâ€™ points of view. Although a number of tools for preference modelling and inspection exist, none are based on detailed data and task models that capture the demands of group decision making in particular. This paper is a first step in addressing this gap. By going through the four stages of the nested model of visualization design, we have developed and tested a prototype to support group decision making when decision makers express their preferences directly on the alternatives.",Group Decision Making;Preference Models;Preference Inspection;Multiform Visualizations;Nested Model;Task Abstractions;Idiom Evaluation;User Studies
IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,AutoCaption: An Approach to Generate Natural Language Description from Visualization Automatically,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In this paper, we propose a novel approach to generate captions for visualization charts automatically. In the proposed method, visual marks and visual channels, together with the associated text information in the original charts, are first extracted and identified with a multilayer perceptron classifier. Meanwhile, data information can also be retrieved by parsing visual marks with extracted mapping relationships. Then a 1-D convolutional residual network is employed to analyze the relationship between visual elements, and recognize significant features of the visualization charts, with both data and visual information as input. In the final step, the full description of the visual charts can be generated through a template-based approach. The generated captions can effectively cover the main visual features of the visual charts and support major feature types in commons charts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through several cases.",

All publications are categorised with regard to publication type, publication venue, application domain, target user, and evaluation type. We present an interactive web-based browser that facilitates easy visual search and exploration of the publications included in the survey.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,A Visual Analytics Framework for Reviewing Streaming Performance Data,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Understanding and tuning the performance of extreme-scale parallel computing systems demands a streaming approach due to the computational cost of applying offline algorithms to vast amounts of performance log data. Analyzing large streaming data is challenging because the rate of receiving data and limited time to comprehend data make it difficult for the analysts to sufficiently examine the data without missing important changes or patterns. To support streaming data analysis, we introduce a visual analytic framework comprising of three modules: data management, analysis, and interactive visualization. The data management module collects various computing and communication performance metrics from the monitored system using streaming data processing techniques and feeds the data to the other two modules. The analysis module automatically identifies important changes and patterns at the required latency. In particular, we introduce a set of online and progressive analysis methods for not only controlling the computational costs but also helping analysts better follow the critical aspects of the analysis results. Finally, the interactive visualization module provides the analysts with a coherent view of the changes and patterns in the continuously captured performance data. Through a multi-faceted case study on performance analysis of parallel discrete-event simulation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for identifying bottlenecks and locating outliers.",Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization application domains;Visual analytics
IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,PINGU Principles of Interactive Navigation for Geospatial Understanding,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Monitoring conditions in the periglacial areas of Antarctica helps geographers and geologists to understand physical processes associated with mesoscale land systems. Analyzing these unique temporal datasets poses a significant challenge for domain experts, due to the complex and often incomplete data, for which corresponding exploratory tools are not available. In this paper, we present a novel visual analysis tool for extraction and interactive exploration of temporal measurements captured at the polar station at the James Ross Island in Antarctica. The tool allows domain experts to quickly extract information about the snow level, originating from a series of photos acquired by trail cameras. Using linked views, the domain experts can interactively explore and combine this information with other spatial and non-spatial measures, such as temperature or wind speed, to reveal the interplay of periglacial and aeolian processes. An abstracted interactive map of the area indicates the position of measurement spots to facilitate navigation. The design of the tool was made in tight collaboration with geographers, which resulted in an early prototype, tested in the pilot study. The following version of the tool and its usability has been evaluated in the user study with five domain experts and their feedback was incorporated into the final version, presented in this paper. This version was again discussed with two experts in an informal interview.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2020,A Radial Visualisation for Model Comparison and Feature Identification,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Machine Learning (ML) plays a key role in various intelligent systems, and building an effective ML model for a data set is a difficult task involving various steps including data cleaning, feature definition and extraction, ML algorithms development, model training and evaluation as well as others. One of the most important steps in the process is to compare generated substantial amounts of ML models to find the optimal one for the deployment. It is challenging to compare such models with dynamic number of features. This paper proposes a novel visualisation approach based on a radial net to compare ML models trained with a different number of features of a given data set while revealing implicit dependent relations. In the proposed approach, ML models and features are represented by lines and arcs respectively. The dependence of ML models with dynamic number of features is encoded into the structure of visualisation, where ML models and their dependent features are directly revealed from related line connections. ML model performance information is encoded with colour and line width in the innovative visualisation. Together with the structure of visualization, feature importance can be directly discerned to help to understand ML models.",Machine learning;performance;comparison;visualisation

IEEE,conferencePaper,2019,CorFish: Coordinating Emphasis Across Multiple Views Using Spatial Distortion,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In the context of multiple views, coordination is essential to navigate and grasp the relationships lying behind the different juxtaposed views. Linked highlighting is a typical example of coordination where a subset of the data points is emphasized simultaneously on all views. The strength of this approach is that the selected data can be studied within its context. Other approaches have been used to implement coordination such as using varying levels of transparency or visual links. We propose to use spatial distortion to contribute a similar effect in multiple views. It is particularly suited to the context of multiple views since it alleviates the lack of screen space by reallocating it based on a certain definition of user interest. The proposed method targets coordination between views that represent the same entities and readily adapts to various visualization forms. It is based on a user degree-of-interest function, defined on these entities, that acts as a common ground for the distortion of all views. Views are distorted such that empty areas and areas holding entities of lesser interest are compressed to the benefit of areas holding entities of higher interest. To demonstrate its feasibility and versatility, we describe how to technically apply our approach to several common visualization techniques.",coordinated multiple views;focus+context visualization;interactive visualization
IEEE,conferencePaper,2019,Collaborative Visual Analysis with Multi-level Information Sharing Using a Wall-Size Display and See-Through HMDs,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Solving complex data analysis problems can often benefit a collaborative effort. For synchronous co-located collaboration, a well-recognized challenge is to deliver different contents to people with different privileges and different responsibilities. This challenge is becoming more obvious with the use of a shared display space such as a wall-size display. In particular, scenarios often arise that a privileged participant needs to access sensitive information that other participants are not permitted to view. This is nearly impossible to achieve with only a single display. As a result, it becomes clear that additional devices are needed to provide some of the participants the capability to access and manage certain information in a private space. In this work, we investigate incorporating optical see-through head-mounted displays (OST-HMDs) with a wall-size display to deliver sensitive information in a synchronous co-located, collaborative setting. With our prototype system, we conduct a user study to observe the collaboration styles under this unique setup. We also present the lessons learned by reflecting on the iterative design process of our prototype system.",augmented reality;collaborative visual analysis;head mounted display;privacy;synchronous co located collaboration;wall size display

Users can also press their fingers to hold other parts of the data fixed during the deformation, or perform cutting on the data using a finger. The deformation is executed using a physically-based mesh, which is constructed to incorporate data properties to make the deformation authentic as well as informative. By manipulating data features as if handling an object in hand, we can successfully achieve less occluded view of the data, or improved feature layout for better view comparison.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2019,Jacob's Ladder: The User Implications of Leveraging Graph Pivots,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"This paper reports on a simple visual technique that boils extracting a subgraph down to two operations-pivots and filters-that is agnostic to both the data abstraction, and its visual complexity scales independent of the size of the graph. The system's design, as well as its qualitative evaluation with users, clarifies exactly when and how the user's intent in a series of pivots is ambiguous-and, more usefully, when it is not. Reflections on our results show how, in the event of an ambiguous case, this innately practical operation could be further extended into ""smart pivots"" that anticipate the user's intent beyond the current step. They also reveal ways that a series of graph pivots can expose the semantics of the data from the user's perspective, and how this information could be leveraged to create adaptive data abstractions that do not rely as heavily on a system designer to create a comprehensive abstraction that anticipates all the user's tasks.",Information Visualization;Qualitative Evaluation;Graph Database;Graph Pivot

They are defined as self-consistent curves (or curve sets in the more general case) that locally pass through the middle of the scatterplot data. However, computing principal curves that capture well complex scatterplot topologies and are robust to noise is hard and/or slow for large scatterplots. We present a fast and robust approach for computing principal graphs (a generalization of principal curves for more complex topologies) inspired by the similarity to medial descriptors (curves locally centered in a shape).

GIB allows the user to simultaneously view group sizes and inter-and intra-group structures. Several GIB variants have been proposed in the literature; however, their advantages and disadvantages have not been studied from the perspective of human cognition. Therefore, herein, we used eye tracking analysis and user surveys to evaluate the user experience of four GIB variants: Squarified-Treemap GIB(ST-GIB), Croissant-and-Doughnut GIB (CD-GIB), Force-Directed GIB (FD-GIB), and Tree-Reordered GIB (TR-GIB). We found some trade-offs among the methods for each type of user task and that FD-GIB and TR-GIB are superior than the other variants. Although ST-GIB's results were good, links were difficult to read in this graph layout.

Given a text collection, Gibbs MedLDA generates topics as a summary of the text collection. We design a scatter plot to display documents and topics simultaneously to show the topic information, and this helps users explore the text collection structurally and find labels for creating. After labeling documents, Gibbs MedLDA is applied to the text collection with labels again, and it generates both the topic and classification information.

We contribute a thorough analysis of potential sources of information loss involved in these techniques, which include the visual spatialization of text documents, user-steered exploration, and the visual summarization. With lessons learned from previous research, we highlight the various ways those information losses could hamper the exploration. Furthermore, we formally define measures for the aforementioned different types of information losses and bias. Finally, we present the visual cues to depict these quality measures that are seamlessly integrated into the exploration approach.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2019,Analysis of Coupled Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical Simulations of a Generic Nuclear Waste Repository in Clay Rock Using Fiber Surfaces,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"The use of clean and renewable energy and the abandoning of fossil energy have become goals of many national and international energy policies. But even when once accomplished, mankind has to take charge of the relics of the current energy supply system. For example, due to its harmful effects, nuclear waste has to be isolated from the biosphere safely and for sufficiently long times. The geological subsurface is considered as a promising option for the deposition of such by-or end products. In order to investigate the long-term evolution of a repository system, a multiphysics simulation was performed. It combines the structural mechanics of the host rock, the fluid dynamics of formation fluids, and the thermodynamics of all materials resulting in a highly multivariate data set. A visualization of such multiphysics data challenges the current methodology. In this article, we demonstrate how an analysis of a carefully selected subset of the variables in attribute space allows to visualize and interpret the simulation data. We apply a fiber surface extraction algorithm to explore the relationships between these variables. Studying the temporal evolution in attribute space, we found a regionally bulge that could be identified as an effect of the nuclear waste repository because it can be clearly separated from the natural geophysical state prior to waste disposal. Furthermore, we used the extracted fiber surface as a starting point to examine the distribution of other variables inside this area of the physical domain. We conclude this case study with lessons learned from the visualization as well as the geotechnical side.","visualization, multiphysics, geology, fiber surface, interaction"
IEEE,conferencePaper,2019,Visual Exploration of Circulation Rolls in Convective Heat Flows,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"We present techniques to improve the understanding of pattern forming processes in Rayleigh-BÃ©nard-type convective heat transport, through visually guided exploration of convection features in time-averaged turbulent flows. To enable the exploration of roll-like heat transfer pathways and pattern-forming anomalies, we combine feature extraction with interactive visualization of particle trajectories. To robustly determine boundaries between circulation rolls, we propose ridge extraction in a z-averaged temperature field, and in the extracted ridge network we automatically classify topological point defects hinting at pattern forming instabilities. An importance measure based on the circular movement of particles is employed to automatically control the density of 3D trajectories and, thus, enable insights into the heat flow in the interior of rolls. A quantitative analysis of the heat transport within and across cell boundaries, as well as investigations of pattern instabilities in the vicinity of defects, is supported by interactive particle visualization including instant computations of particle density maps. We demonstrate the use of the proposed techniques to explore direct numerical simulations of the 3D Boussinesq equations of convection, giving novel insights into Rayleigh-BÃ©nard-type convective heat transport.","flow visualization, particle-based visualzation, convective heat transport"
IEEE,conferencePaper,2019,Visual Analysis of Ligand Trajectories in Molecular Dynamics,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In many cases, protein reactions with other small molecules (ligands) occur in a deeply buried active site. When studying these types of reactions, it is crucial for biochemists to examine trajectories of ligand motion. These trajectories are predicted with in-silico methods that produce large ensembles of possible trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the interactive visual exploration and analysis of large sets of ligand trajectories, enabling the domain experts to understand protein function based on the trajectory properties. The proposed solution is composed of multiple linked 2D and 3D views, enabling the interactive exploration and filtering of trajectories in an informed way. In the workflow, we focus on the practical aspects of the interactive visual analysis specific to ligand trajectories. We adapt the small multiples principle to resolve an overly large number of trajectories into smaller chunks that are easier to analyze. We describe how drill-down techniques can be used to create and store selections of the trajectories with desired properties, enabling the comparison of multiple datasets. In appropriately designed 2D and 3D views, biochemists can either observe individual trajectories or choose to aggregate the information into a functional boxplot or density visualization. Our solution is based on a tight collaboration with the domain experts, aiming to address their needs as much as possible. The usefulness of our novel approach is demonstrated by two case studies, conducted by the collaborating protein engineers.",visualization;trajectory;protein;ligand

IEEE,conferencePaper,2019,Uncertainty-Aware Ramachandran Plots,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Ramachandran Plots are an important tool for researchers in bio-chemistry to examine the stability of a molecule. In these plots, dihedral (torsion) angles of the protein's backbone are visualized ona plane, where different areas are known to be stable configurations. Unfortunately, the underlying atom positions are affected by uncer-tainty, which is usually captured and expressed using the b-value. For classic Ramachandran Plots, this uncertainty is not propagatedwhen computing the dihedral angles and neglected when visualizinga Ramachandran Plot. To solve this problem, this paper presentsan extended version of the Ramachandran Plot, which allows tocommunicate the uncertainty of atom positions along the compu-tation of dihedral angles and an intuitive visualization. We showthe effectiveness of the presented approach by examining differentRamachandran Plots for molecules and show how the inclusion ofuncertainty helps biochemistry researchers to determine the stabilityof a protein with higher accuracy.","Uncertainty Visualization, Molecular Visualization, Ramachandran Plot"

We incorporate this technique into an interactive visualization with multiple linked phase plots, and extend the distance plot to also visualize marker particle weights from particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations together with the phase space trajectories. By linking the distance plot with phase plots, one can more easily investigate the spatiotemporal patterns, and by extending the plot to visualize particle weights in conjunction with the phase space trajectories, the visualization better supports the needs of domain experts studying particle-in-cell simulations.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2019,Designing Narrative Slideshows for Learning Analytics,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"The practical power of data visualization is currently attracting much attention in the e-learning domain. A growing number of studies have been conducted in recent years to help instructors better analyze learner behavior and reflect on their teaching. However, current e-learning dashboards and visualization systems usually require a lot of time and effort into the exploration process. Moreover, the lack of communication power of existing systems constrains users from organizing the narrative of information pieces into a compelling data story. In this paper, we have proposed a narrative visualization approach with an interactive slideshow that helps instructors and education experts explore potential learning patterns and convey data stories. This approach contains three key components: guided-tour concept, drill-down path, and dig-in exploration dimension. The use cases further demonstrate the potential of employing this visual narrative approach in the e-learning context.",Human-centered-computing;Visualization;Visualization-application-domains;Information-Visualization
IEEE,conferencePaper,2019,A Visual Approach for the Comparative Analysis of Character Networks in Narrative Texts,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"The analysis of a novel's plot and characters are challenging and time-consuming tasks in literary criticism. Typically, humanities scholars want to describe and compare characters' personality traits, their roles, their relationships, and the evolution of these aspects over the course of a novel. Nowadays, due to the digitization of literature, humanities scholars can be supported in these endeavors with computational methods. In this paper, we present an approach that offers several means to analyze the plot and characters of a novel visually. Analysts can easily switch between an adjacency matrix and a node-link representation, which provide an overview of the characters and the relationships between them. Both views enable analysts to select different text ranges of the novel for studying the commonalities and differences of the character constellations within these ranges. We offer interactive visual representations to help investigate the relationships between the characters in more detail. Additionally, we link the visual representations with the novels' texts to support the inspection and verification of previously generated ideas and hypotheses. To demonstrate the benefits and limitations of our approach, we present two usage scenarios. The first one is based on a fictitious analysis and the second one discusses applications that were carried out during joint workshops with humanities scholars. Finally, we present and discuss the insights gained by an expert study and the design decisions of our approach.","Visual text analysis, document analysis, close reading, distant reading, digital humanities, graph comparison"

The application allows museum staff to capture detailed information describing how visitors move around an exhibition and interact with individual exhibits. They can then visualize the results of tracking either on a single mobile device or with multiple mobile devices connected to a large display. The platform uses orthogonal views of the exhibition space for tracking and visualization, with a chess-piece icon to represent visitors during tracking, and curved semi-transparent lines with animated semi-circles to communicate the path and direction of visitor movement. Our visualization is novel in its use of an orthogonal projection for pedestrian tracking and animation to communicate the flow of visitors around the exhibition space, as well as allowing users to dynamically switch between views representing different groups of visitors. The design of our application was informed through an extensive requirements analysis study conducted with Nanjing Museum and evaluated by conducting expert interviews with museum managers who considered that the application allowed for more effective and efficient recording and analysis of visitor tracking data.",Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization application domains;Information visualization

By exploring the datasets from different simulation runs, cosmologists can understand the evolution of our universe and approach its initial conditions. A cosmological simulation nowadays can generate datasets on the order of petabytes. Moving datasets from the supercomputers to post data analysis machines is infeasible. We propose a novel approach called statistical super-resolution to tackle the big data problem for cosmological data analysis and visualization. It uses datasets from a few simulation runs to create a prior knowledge, which captures the relation between low-and high-resolution data. We apply in situ statistical down-sampling to datasets generated from simulation runs to minimize the requirements of I/O bandwidth and storage.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,Optimal Algorithms for Compact Linear Layouts,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Linear layouts are a simple and natural way to draw a graph: all vertices are placed on a single line and edges are drawn as arcs between the vertices. Despite its simplicity, a linear layout can be a very meaningful visualization if there is a particular order defined on the vertices. Common examples of such ordered - and often also directed - graphs are event sequences and processes. A main drawback of linear layouts are the usually (very) large aspect ratios of the resulting drawings, which prevent users from obtaining a good overview of the whole graph. In this paper we present a novel and versatile algorithm to optimally fold a linear layout of a graph such that it can be drawn nicely in a specified aspect ratio, while still clearly communicating the linearity of the layout. Our algorithm allows vertices to be drawn as blocks or rectangles of specified sizes to incorporate different drawing styles, label sizes, and even recursive structures. For reasonably-sized drawings the folded layout can be computed interactively. We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm on graphs that represent process trees, a particular type of process model. Our algorithm arguably produces much more readable layouts than existing methods.",Graph/Network Data;Geometry based Techniques;Linear layouts;Folding
IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,BC Tree-Based Proxy Graphs for Visualization of Big Graphs,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Recent work for visualizing big graphs uses a proxy graph approach: the original graph is replaced by a proxy graph, which is much smaller than the original graph. The challenge for the proxy graph approach is to ensure that the proxy graph is a good representation of the original graph. However, previous work to compute proxy graphs using graph sampling techniques often fails to preserve connectivity and important global skeletal structure in the original graph. This paper introduces two new families of proxy graph methods BCP-W and BCP-E, tightly integrating graph sampling methods with the BC (Block Cut-vertex) tree, which represents the decomposition of a graph into biconnected components. Experimental results using graph sampling quality metrics show that our new BC treebased proxy graph methods produce significantly better results than existing sampling-based proxy graph methods: 25% improvement by BCP-W and 15% by BCP-E on average. We also present DBCP, a BC tree-based proxy graph method for distributed environment. Experiments on the Amazon Cloud EC2 demonstrate that DBCP is scalable for big graph data sets; runtime speed-up of 77% for distributed 5-server on average. Visual comparison using a graph layout method and the proxy quality metrics confirm that our new BC tree-based proxy graph methods are significantly better than existing sampling-based proxy graph method. Our main results lead to guidelines for computing sampling-based proxy graphs for visualization of big graphs.",Visualization Visualisation Technique

IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,Image and Distribution Based Volume Rendering for Large Data Sets,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Analyzing scientific datasets created from simulations on modern supercomputers is a daunting challenge due to the fast pace at which these datasets continue to grow. Low cost post analysis machines used by scientists to view and analyze these massive datasets are severely limited by their deficiencies in storage bandwidth, capacity, and computational power. Trying to simply move these datasets to these platforms is infeasible. Any approach to view and analyze these datasets on post analysis machines will have to effectively address the inevitable problem of data loss. Image based approaches are well suited for handling very large datasets on low cost platforms. Three challenges with these approaches are how to effectively represent the original data with minimal data loss, analyze the data in regards to transfer function exploration, which is a key analysis tool, and quantify the error from data loss during analysis. We present a novel image based approach using distributions to preserve data integrity. At each view sample, view dependent data is summarized at each pixel with distributions to define a compact proxy for the original dataset. We present this representation along with how to manipulate and render large scale datasets on post analysis machines. We show that our approach is a good trade off between rendering quality and interactive speed and provides uncertainty quantification for the information that is lost.",Distribution based;volume rendering;big data

In this paper, we introduce a novel volume interaction approach based on smart widgets that are automatically placed directly into the data in a visibility-driven manner. By adapting to what the user actually sees, they act as proxies that allow for goal-oriented modifications while still providing an intuitive set of simple operations that is easy to control. In particular, our method is well-suited for direct manipulation scenarios such as touch screens, where traditional user interface elements commonly exhibit limited utility.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,Topologically Controlled Lossy Compression,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"This paper presents a new algorithm for the lossy compression of scalar data defined on 2D or 3D regular grids, with topological control. Certain techniques allow users to control the pointwise error induced by the compression. However, in many scenarios it is desirable to control in a similar way the preservation of higher-level notions, such as topological features, in order to provide guarantees on the outcome of post-hoc data analyses. This paper presents the first compression technique for scalar data which supports a strictly controlled loss of topological features. It provides users with specific guarantees both on the preservation of the important features and on the size of the smaller features destroyed during compression. In particular, we present a simple compression strategy based on a topologically adaptive quantization of the range. Our algorithm provides strong guarantees on the bottleneck distance between persistence diagrams of the input and decompressed data, specifically those associated with extrema. A simple extension of our strategy additionally enables a control on the pointwise error. We also show how to combine our approach with state-of-the-art compressors, to further improve the geometrical reconstruction. Extensive experiments, for comparable compression rates, demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm in terms of the preservation of topological features. We show the utility of our approach by illustrating the compatibility between the output of post-hoc topological data analysis pipelines, executed on the input and decompressed data, for simulated or acquired data sets. We also provide a lightweight VTK-based C++ implementation of our approach for reproduction purposes.",Scalar fields;Compression;Topological Data Analysis

The compressed bitmap indexing is one of the emerging data representation used for large-scale data exploration. Performing sampling on the bitmapindexing based data representation allows further reduction of storage overhead and be more flexible to meet the requirements of different applications. In this paper, we propose two approaches to solve two potential limitations when exploring and visualizing the data using sampling-based bitmap indexing data representation. First, we propose an adaptive sampling approach called information guided stratified sampling (IGStS) for creating compact sampled datasets that preserves the important characteristics of the raw data. Furthermore, we propose a novel data recovery approach to reconstruct the irregular subsampled dataset into a volume dataset with regular grid structure for qualitative post-hoc data exploration and visualization.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,In Situ Prediction Driven Feature Analysis in Jet Engine Simulations,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Efficient feature exploration in large-scale data sets using traditional post-hoc analysis approaches is becoming prohibitive due to the bottleneck stemming from I/O and output data sizes. This problem becomes more challenging when an ensemble of simulations are required to run for studying the influence of input parameters on the model output. As a result, scientists are inclining more towards analyzing the data in situ while it resides in the memory. In situ analysis aims at minimizing expensive data movement while maximizing the resource utilization for extraction of important information from the data. In this work, we study the evolution of rotating stall in jet engines using data generated from a large-scale flow simulation under various input conditions. Since the features of interest lack a precise descriptor, we adopt a fuzzy rule-based machine learning algorithm for efficient and robust extraction of such features. For scalable exploration, we advocate for an off-line learning and in situ prediction driven strategy that facilitates in-depth study of the stall. Task-specific information estimated in situ is visualized interactively during the post-hoc analysis revealing important details about the inception and evolution of stall. We verify and validate our method through comprehensive expert evaluation demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.",In situ analysis;machine learning in visualization;fuzzy rule based system;multivariate analysis;rotating stall;big data analytics

IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,Dynamic Data Repartitioning for Load-Balanced Parallel Particle Tracing,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"We present a novel dynamic load-balancing algorithm based on data repartitioning for parallel particle tracing in flow visualization. Instead of static data assignment, we dynamically repartition the data into blocks and reassign the blocks to processes to balance the workload distribution among the processes. Block repartitioning is performed based on a dynamic workload estimation method that predicts the workload in the flow field on the fly as the input. In our approach, we allow data duplication in the repartitioning, enabling the same data blocks to be assigned to multiple processes. Load balance is achieved by regularly exchanging the blocks (together with the particles in the blocks) among processes according to the output of the data repartitioning. Compared with other load-balancing algorithms, our approach does not need any preprocessing on the raw data and does not require any dedicated process for work scheduling, while it has the capability to balance uneven workload efficiently. Results show improved load balance and high efficiency of our method on tracing particles in both steady and unsteady flow.",Parallel particle tracing;dynamic load balancing;data repartitioning
IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,Uncertainty Visualization for Secondary Structures of Proteins,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"We present a technique that conveys the uncertainty in the secondary structure of proteins-an abstraction model based on atomic coordinates. While protein data inherently contains uncertainty due to the acquisition method or the simulation algorithm, we argue that it is also worth investigating uncertainty induced by analysis algorithms that precede visualization. Our technique helps researchers investigate differences between multiple secondary structure assignment methods. We modify established algorithms for fuzzy classification and introduce a discrepancy-based approach to project an ensemble of sequences to a single importance-weighted sequence. In 2D, we depict the aggregated secondary structure assignments based on the per-residue deviation in a collapsible sequence diagram. In 3D, we extend the ribbon diagram using visual variables such as transparency, wave form, frequency, or amplitude to facilitate qualitative analysis of uncertainty. We evaluated the effectiveness and acceptance of our technique through expert reviews using two example applications: the combined assignment against established algorithms and time-dependent structural changes originating from simulated protein dynamics.",Scientific Visualization;Molecular Visualization

IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,Composite Visual Mapping for Time Series Visualization,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In the information visualization reference model, visual mapping is the most crucial step in producing a visualization from a data set. The conventional visual mapping maps each data attribute onto a single visual channel (e.g. the year of production of a car to the position on the horizontal axis). In this work, we investigate composite visual mapping: mapping single data attributes onto several visual channels, each one representing one aspect of the data attribute (e.g. its order of magnitude, or its trend component). We first propose a table which allows us to explore the design space of composite mappings by offering a systematic overview of channel combinations. We expect that using more than one visual channel for communicating a data attribute increases the bandwidth of information presentation by displaying separable information on different aspects of data. In order to evaluate this point, we compare horizon graph, an existing technique which successfully adopts a composite visual mapping, with a selection of alternative composite mappings. We show that some of those mappings perform as well as â€“and in some cases even better thanâ€“ horizon graph in terms of accuracy and speed. Our results confirm that the benefits of composite visual mapping are not limited to horizon graph. We thus recommend the use of composite visual mapping when users are simultaneously interested in several aspects of data attributes.",Information visualization;time series

Its main tool, persistent homology, has become a popular technique to study the structure of complex, high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a novel method using persistent homology to quantify structural changes in time-varying graphs. Specifically, we transform each instance of the time-varying graph into a metric space, extract topological features using persistent homology, and compare those features over time. We provide a visualization that assists in time-varying graph exploration and helps to identify patterns of behavior within the data. To validate our approach, we conduct several case studies on real-world datasets and show how our method can find cyclic patterns, deviations from those patterns, and one-time events in time-varying graphs.

Compared with the previous correlation graph definition, HOCG achieves better user interactivity, computational scalability, and domain generality through synthesizing heterogeneous types of nodes, attributes, and multifaceted relationships in a single graph. We design elaborate visual metaphors, interaction models, and the coordinated multiple view based interface to allow users to fully unleash the visual analytics power over HOCG. We conduct case studies in two real-life application domains, i.e., facility monitoring and software analysis. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of HOCG in the overview of point anomalies, detection of collective anomalies, and reasoning process of root cause analysis.",correlation graph visualization;collective anomaly
IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,Visual Analytics for Networked-Guarantee Loans Risk Management,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Groups of enterprises can guarantee each other and form complex networks in order to try to obtain loans from banks. Monitoring the financial status of a network, and preventing or reducing systematic risk in case of a crisis, is an area of great concern for the regulatory commission and for the banks. We set the ultimate goal of developing a visual analytic approach and tool for risk dissolving and decision-making. We have consolidated four main analysis tasks conducted by financial experts: i) Multi-faceted Default Risk Visualization, whereby a hybrid representation is devised to predict the default risk and an interface developed to visualize key indicators; ii) Risk Guarantee Patterns Discovery. We follow the Shneiderman mantra guidance for designing interactive visualization applications, whereby an interactive risk guarantee community detection and a motif detection based risk guarantee pattern discovery approach are described; iii) Network Evolution and Retrospective, whereby animation is used to help users to understand the guarantee dynamic; iv) Risk Communication Analysis. The temporal diffusion path analysis can be useful for the government and banks to monitor the spread of the default status. It also provides insight for taking precautionary measures to prevent and dissolve systematic financial risk. We implement the system with case studies using real-world bank loan data. Two financial experts are consulted to endorse the developed tool. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first visual analytics tool developed to explore networked-guarantee loan risks in a systematic manner.",H.5.2 [User Interfaces]: User Interfacesâ€”Graphical user interfaces (GUI);H.5.m [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Miscellaneous
IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,FraudVis: Understanding Unsupervised Fraud Detection Algorithms,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Discovering fraud user behaviors is vital to keeping online websites healthy. Fraudsters usually exhibit grouping behaviors, and researchers have effectively leveraged this behavior to design unsupervised algorithms to detect fraud user groups. In this work, we propose a visualization system, FraudVis, to visually analyze the unsupervised fraud detection algorithms from temporal, intra-group correlation, inter-group correlation, feature selection, and the individual user perspectives. FraudVis helps domain experts better understand the algorithm output and the detected fraud behaviors. Meanwhile, FraudVis also helps algorithm experts to fine-tune the algorithm design through the visual comparison. By using the visualization system, we solve two real-world cases of fraud detection, one for a social video website and another for an e-commerce website. The results on both cases demonstrate the effectiveness of FraudVis in understanding unsupervised fraud detection algorithms.",Fraud Detection;Unsupervised Learning;Visualization System

SIGINT, which stands for SIGnal INTelligence, is a field facing many challenges like huge amounts of data, complex data and novice users. HeloVis draws on perceptive biases, highlighted by Gestalt laws, and on depth perception to enhance the recurrence properties contained into the data and to abstract from interferences such as noise or missing data. In this paper, we first present SIGINT and the challenges that it brings to visual analytics. Then, we present the existing work that is currently used in or that fits the SIGINT context.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,Visualizing Deep Neural Networks for Text Analytics,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made tremendous progress in many different areas in recent years. How these networks function internally, however, is often not well understood. Advances in under-standing DNNs will benefit and accelerate the development of the field. We present TNNVis, a visualization system that supports un-derstanding of deep neural networks specifically designed to analyze text. TNNVis focuses on DNNs composed of fully connected and convolutional layers. It integrates visual encodings and interaction techniques chosen specifically for our tasks. The tool allows users to: (1) visually explore DNN models with arbitrary input using a combination of node-link diagrams and matrix representation; (2) quickly identify activation values, weights, and feature map patterns within a network; (3) flexibly focus on visual information of interest with threshold, inspection, insight query, and tooltip operations; (4) discover network activation and training patterns through animation; and (5) compare differences between internal activation patterns for different inputs to the DNN. These functions allow neural network researchers to examine their DNN models from new perspectives, producing insights on how these models function. Clustering and summarization techniques are employed to support large convolutional and fully connected layers. Based on several part of speech models with different structure and size, we present multiple use cases where visualization facilitates an understanding of the models.",information visualization;deep learning;machine learning;visualization design;human centered computing
IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,TagNet: Toward Tag-Based Sentiment Analysis of Large Social Media Data,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Hashtags and replies, originally introduced on Twitter, have become the most popular ways to tag short messages in social networks. While the primary uses of these human-labeled metadata are still for message retrieval and clustering, there have been increasing attempts to use them as subject or topic indicators in measuring people's continuous sentiments in large message corpora. However, conducting the analysis for large social media data is still challenging due to the message volume, heterogeneity, and temporal dependence. In this paper, we present TagNet, a novel visualization approach tailored to the tag-based sentiment analysis. TagNet combines traditional tag clouds with an improved node-link diagram to represent the time-varying heterogeneous information with reduced visual clutter. A force model is leveraged to generate layout aesthetics from which the temporal patterns of tags can be easily compared across different subsets of data. It is enhanced by visual encodings for quickly estimating the time-varying sentiment. Interaction tools are provided to improve the scalability for exploring large corpora. An example Twitter corpus illustrates the applicability and usefulness of TagNet.",tag cloud;sentiment analysis;social media;data visualization
IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,An Evaluation of Perceptually Complementary Views for Multivariate Data,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"We evaluate the relative merits of three techniques for visualising multivariate data: parallel coordinates; scatterplot matrix; and a side-by-side, coordinated combination of these views. In particular, we report on: (1) the most effective visual encoding of multivariate data for each of the six common tasks considered; (2) common strategies that our participants used when the two views were combined based on eye-tracking data analysis; (3) the finding that these views are perceptually complementary in the sense that they both show the same information, but with different and complementary support for different types of analysis. For the combined view, our studies show that there is a perceptually complementary effect in terms of significantly improved accuracy for certain tasks, but that there is a small cost in terms of slightly longer completion time than the faster of the two techniques alone. Eye-movement data shows that for many tasks participants were able to swiftly switch their strategies after trying both in the training phase.",Information Visualisation;Perceptually Complementary views;Multivariate data;High dimensional data visualisation;Side by side;Parallel coordinates;scatterplot matrix
IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,Know Your Enemy: Identifying Quality Problems of Time Series Data,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Sensible data analysis requires data quality control. An essential part of this is data profiling, which is the identification and assessment of data quality problems as a prerequisite for adequately handling these problems. Differentiating between actual quality problems and unusual, but valid data values requires the ""human-in-the-loop"" through the use of visual analytics. Unfortunately, existing approaches for data profiling do not adequately support the special characteristics of time, which is imperative to identify quality problems in time series data - a data type prevalent in a multitude of disciplines. In this design study paper, we outline the design, implementation, and evaluation of ""Know Your Enemy"" (KYE) - a visual analytics approach to assess the quality of time series data. KYE supports the task of data profiling with (1) predefined data quality checks, (2) user-definable, customized quality checks, (3) interactive visualization to explore and reason about automatically detected problems, and (4) the visual identification of hidden quality problems.",data quality;data profiling;time series;visual analytics

For egocentric data exploration, the occlusion problems, caused by the camera being too close to opaque data elements, have not been well addressed by previous studies. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach to resolve these problems and provide an occlusion free egocentric data exploration. Our system utilizes a state transition model to monitor both the camera and the data, and manages the initiation, duration, and termination of deformation with animation. Our method can be applied to multiple types of scientific datasets, including volumetric data, polygon mesh data, and particle data. We demonstrate our method with different exploration tasks, including camera navigation, isovalue adjustment, transfer function adjustment, and time varying exploration.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,Exploring the Role of Sound in Augmenting Visualization to Enhance User Engagement,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Studies on augmenting visualization with sound are typically based on the assumption that sound can be complementary and assist in data analysis tasks. While sound promotes a different sense of engagement than vision, we conjecture that by augmenting non-speech audio to a visualization can not only help enhance the users' perception of the data but also increase their engagement with the data exploration process. We have designed a preliminary user study to test users' performance and engagement while exploring in a data visualization system under two different settings: visual-only and audiovisual. For our study, we used basketball player movement data in a game and created an interactive visualization system with three linked views. We supplemented sound to the visualization to enhance the users' understanding of a team's offensive/defensive behavior. The results of our study suggest that we need to better understand the effect of sound choice and encoding before considering engagement. We also find that sound can be useful to draw novice users' attention to patterns or anomalies in the data. Finally, we propose follow-up studies with designs informed by the findings from this study.",sound-augmented visualization;engagement
IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,A Comparative 3D Visualization Tool for Observation of Mode Water,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Mode water forms a 3D region of seawater mass, which has similar physical characteristics values. Research and observation of mode water have a long history in physical oceanography because analysis of mode water brings the understanding of various natural phenomena. There have been various definitions of mode water, and comparison of mode water regions extracted with such various definitions is an important issue in this field. This paper presents our study on comparative 3D visualization tool for the comparison of mode water regions. We extract pairs of outer boundaries of mode water regions as isosurfaces and calculate dissimilarity values between the pairs. The tool visualizes the multi-dimensional vectors of the dissimilarity values by Parallel Coordinate Plots (PCP) and provides a user interface to specify particular pairs of mode water regions so that we can comparatively visualize the shapes of the regions.

However, treating the animated mesh data efficiently remains a challenging task due to its large scale and limited feature descriptors. In this paper, we present an evolutionary signature for animated meshes based on tempo-spatial segmentation. In specific, we first conduct temporal segmentation to a given animated meshes with sub-motions, then apply spatial segmentation within each temporal segment, and intersect spatial segmentation result for over segmentation. Thirdly, we represent the segmentation results into graphs. Finally, we devise an edge evolution matrix based on the dynamic behaviour of each edge for the evolutionary signature of the input animated mesh. Our experimental results on similarity measurement by using the proposed signature reflect the effectiveness of our method.",animated mesh;evolutionary signature;segmentation

IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,Keynote speaker: Changing the world with visual analytics,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"To solve the world's challenges requires not only advancing computer science and big data analytics but requires new analysis and decision-making environments that effectively couple human decision making with advanced, guided analytics in a human-computer collaborative discourse and decision making (HCCD). While many researchers and companies are focusing solely on Big Data Analytics to harness the potential power in available massive, multisource, multivariate, evolving digital data, many of these big data solutions don't effectively factor the human decision maker into their proposed solution. The HCCD approach builds upon visual analytics and focuses on empowering the decision maker through interactive visual analytic environments where visual cognition, guided discovery, and non-digital human expertise and experience can be combined with state-of-the-art analytical techniques. When we combine this approach with real-world application-driven research, not only does the pace of scientific innovation accelerate, but impactful change occurs. This work and these systems can be applied to social change, advancing engineering, and science and solving some of the world's greatest challenges such as sustainability and security. In this talk, I'll outline this approach and highlight the potential and impact of application driven HCCD research.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,Keynote speaker: Requirements and recent directions in augmented reality visualization,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"The field of information visualization studies the interactive visual representations of data to reinforce human cognition, thereby facilitate the discovery of new tacit knowledge and even amplify human intelligence. Augmented reality (AR) shares the same objective and it can be treated as one particular form of information visualization where the data are both the real objects and the augmentations for them. As such, it presents a unique set of problems within the general requirements for an effective information visualization method. In this talk, I will first outline and put forth four main requirements for AR visualization, namely, (1) naturalness, (2) visibility (3) persistance/stability and (4) glass/hmd ergonomics. Then I will present a short survey of the existing AR visualization techniques and characterize them by their attributes and categorize them in terms of how they satisfy or address the proposed requirements. Finally, I will also introduce some of my own on-going research work in this area, specifically, for real time contrast adjustment for mobile augmented reality, usability with glasses, augmentation data organization, and multimodal AR data presentation. I hope that this work can instigate and shed some light on the future directions for further research in AR visualization techniques.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,HoNVis: Visualizing and exploring higher-order networks,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Unlike the conventional first-order network (FoN), the higher-order network (HoN) provides a more accurate description of transitions by creating additional nodes to encode higher-order dependencies. However, there exists no visualization and exploration tool for the HoN. For applications such as the development of strategies to control species invasion through global shipping which is known to exhibit higher-order dependencies, the existing FoN visualization tools are limited. In this paper, we present HoNVis, a novel visual analytics framework for exploring higher-order dependencies of the global ocean shipping network. Our framework leverages coordinated multiple views to reveal the network structure at three levels of detail (i.e., the global, local, and individual port levels). Users can quickly identify ports of interest at the global level and specify a port to investigate its higher-order nodes at the individual port level. Investigating a larger-scale impact is enabled through the exploration of HoN at the local level. Using the global ocean shipping network data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a real-world use case conducted by domain experts specializing in species invasion. Finally, we discuss the generalizability of this framework to other real-world applications such as information diffusion in social networks and epidemic spreading through air transportation.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,Privacy preserving visualization for social network data with ontology information,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Analyzing social network data helps sociologists understand the behaviors of individuals and groups as well as the relationships between them. With additional ontology information, the semantics behind the network structure can be further explored. Unfortunately, creating network visualizations with these datasets for presentation can inadvertently expose the private and sensitive information of individuals that reside in the data. To deal with this problem, we generalize conventional data anonymization models (originally designed for relational data) and formally apply them in the context of privacy preserving ontological network visualization. We use these models to identify the privacy leaks that exist in a visualization, provide graph modification actions that remove and/or perceptually minimize the effect of the identified leaks, and discuss strategies for what types of privacy actions to choose depending on the context of the leaks. We implement an ontological visualization interface with associated privacy preserving operations, and demonstrate with two case studies using real-world datasets to show that our approach can identify and solve potential privacy issues while balancing overall graph readability and utility.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,k-core based multi-level graph visualization for scale-free networks,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"We present a new multi-level graph drawing algorithm based on the k-core coarsening, a well-known cohesive subgroup analysis method in social network analysis. The k-core of a graph is also known as the degeneracy in graph theory, and can be computed in linear time. Our k-core based multi-level algorithm also includes a new concentric circle placement and a variation of force-directed layout to display the structure of graphs effectively. Experiments with real-world networks suggest that our algorithm performs well for visualization of large and complex scale-free networks, with a power-law degree distribution, a short diameter and a high clustering coefficient. Comparison with other multi-level algorithms shows that our method is fast and effective, in particular performs better than Walshaw [26] and FM3 [15].",I.3.3 [Computer Graphics]: Picture/Image Generationâ€”Line and curve generation
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,NetSet: A systematic integration of visualization for analyzing set intersections with network,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Many researchers have been studied visualization techniques to represent relationships between sets. However, most recent studies focused on the scalability of visualizing set relations, rather than on set-typed data itself. Although solving such problems is important, understanding the structural context of the entire data is also essential for analyzing data. We propose NetSet, which combines two techniques to resolve the limitations in representing set relationships. First, we construct a network to provide a structural overview of the set system. Then, we place a matrix layout to visualize intersections among sets. Finally, by combining these two techniques, NetSet enables them to complement each other. The combination gives analysts both the overview and specific views of the data. Furthermore, NetSet provides both flexible exploration of a set system and quantitative analysis of set intersections. We conducted a case study to demonstrate how the combination can be successfully applied to real data, namely topic-talks data from the TED organization.",Set;set visualization;multi-view visualization
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,A visual analytics approach for understanding egocentric intimacy network evolution and impact propagation in MMORPGs,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Massively Multiplayer Online Role-playing Games (MMORPGs) feature a large number of players socially interacting with one another in an immersive gaming environment. A successful MMORPG should engage players and meet their needs to achieve different categories of gratifications. Research on the evolution of player social interaction network and the dynamics of inter-player intimacy could provide insights into players' gratification-oriented behaviors in MMORPGs. Such understanding could in turn guide game designs for better engaging existing players and marketing strategies for attracting newcomers. Conventional dynamic network analysis may help investigate game-based social interactions at the macroscopic level. However, current dynamic network visualization techniques mainly focus on illustrating topological changes of the entire network, which are unsuitable for analyzing player-specific social interactions in the virtual world from an egocentric perspective. In general, game designers and operators find it difficult to analyze the way players with different gratification needs may interact with one another and the consequences on their relationships with direct ties, using a decentralized social graph with complicated time-varying structures. In this paper, we present MMOSeer, a visual analytics system for exploring the evolution of egocentric player intimacy network. MMOSeer focuses on the relationship between a player (ego) and his/her directly-linked friends (alters). We follow a user-centered design process to develop the system with game analysts and apply novel visualization techniques in conjunction with well-established algorithms to depict the evolution of intimacy egocentric network. We also derive a centrality change metric to infer how the impact of changes in an ego's interactive behaviors may propagate through the intimacy network, reshaping the structure of the alters' social circles at both micro and macro levels. Finally, we validate the usability of MMOSeer by discovering different user interaction patterns and the corresponding ego-network structural changes in a real-world gameplay dataset from a commercial MMORPG.",H.5.2 [INFORMATION INTERFACES AND PRESENTATION]: User Interfacesâ€”Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)

How to interact with data in an immersive 3D space is both an interesting and challenging problem, demanding more research investigations. In this paper, we present a gesture input system for graph visualization in a stereoscopic 3D space.

SD coordination is intended to lower the user's cognitive load when exploring complex multi-dimensional data such as biomedical data, multiple data attributes vs time in a space-time-cube visualisation, or three-dimensional projections of three-or-higher-dimensional data sets. To inform the design of interaction devices to allow for SD coordination, we define a design space and demonstrate it with sketches and early prototypes of three exemplar devices for SD coordinated interaction.",

Occlusion management and context preservation are among the key factors to ensure effective identification and extraction of three-dimensional features. In this paper, we present an interactive data exploration system that utilizes a physically based deformation method to investigate hidden structures of data in three dimensional data sets. While non-physically based methods are popular for visual analytic applications due to their lower computational cost, physically based deformation methods can often better preserve features and their context. Our physically based deformation method preserves data features by setting the mesh properties according to interesting data attributes. We design effective and intuitive interfaces by using a metaphor of virtual retractor, which reflects the cutting and splitting of data that our system is simulating.

Vortices, which determine all electromagnetic properties of type-II superconductors, are extracted and tracked at the same time with GPU-based time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau superconductor simulations. The in situ workflow involves three parts: (1) a tightly coupled GPU-accelerated algorithm that detects primitives for ambiguity-free vortex tracking, (2) a loosely coupled task-parallel feature-tracking method, and (3) a web-based remote visualization tool for vortex dynamics analysis. Our design minimizes the data movement and storage, maximizes the resource utilization, and reduces the slowdown of the simulation. Our solution captures all vortex dynamics in the simulation, previously impossible with traditional post hoc methods. We also demonstrate in situ visualization cases that help scientists understand how vortices cut each other and recombine into new vortices, which are directly related to energy dissipation of superconducting materials.",In situ visualization;superconductivity;feature extraction and tracking;GPU algorithm;web-based visualization
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,Designing interactive distance cartograms to support urban travelers,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"A distance cartogram (DC) is a technique that alters distances between a user-specified origin and the other locations in a map with respect to travel time. With DC, users can weigh the relative travel time costs between the origin and potential destinations at a glance because travel times are projected in a linearly interpolated time space from the origin. Such glance-ability is known to be useful for travelers who are mindful of travel time when finding their travel destinations. When constructing DC, however, uneven urban traffic conditions introduce excessive distortion and challenge user intuition. In addition, there has been little research focusing on DC's user interaction design. To tackle these challenges and realize the potential of DC as an interactive decision-making support tool, we derive a set of useful interactions through two formative studies and devise two novel techniques called Geo-contextual Anchoring Projection and Scalable Road-network Construction. We develop an interactive map system using these techniques and evaluate this system by comparing it against an equidistant map (EM), a widely used conventional layout that preserves the geographical reality. Based on the analysis of user behavior and qualitative feedback, we identify several benefits of using DC itself and of the interaction techniques we derived. We also analyze the specific reasons behind these identified benefits.",Distance Cartogram;Geo-contextual Anchoring Projection;Scalable Road-network Construction;Map Interaction
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,MobiSeg: Interactive region segmentation using heterogeneous mobility data,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"With the acceleration of urbanization and modern civilization, more and more complex regions are formed in urban area. Although understanding these regions could provide huge insights to facilitate valuable applications for urban planning and business intelligence, few methods have been developed to effectively capture the rapid transformation of urban regions. In recent years, the widely applied location-acquisition technologies offer a more effective way to capture the dynamics of a city through analyzing people's movement activities based on mobility data. However, several challenges exist, including data sparsity and difficulties in result understanding and validation. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose MobiSeg, an interactive visual analytics system, which supports the exploration of people's movement activities to segment the urban area into regions sharing similar activity patterns. A joint analysis is conducted on three types of heterogeneous mobility data (i.e., taxi trajectories, metro passenger RFID card data, and telco data), which can complement each other and provide a full picture of people's activities in a region. In addition, advanced analytical algorithms (e.g., non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based method to capture latent activity patterns, as well as metric learning to calibrate and supervise the underlying analysis) and novel visualization designs are integrated into our system to provide a comprehensive solution to region segmentation in urban areas. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system via case studies with real-world datasets and qualitative interviews with domain experts.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,Exploring the evolution of pressure-perturbations to understand atmospheric phenomena,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Atmospheric sciences is the study of physical and chemical phenomena occurring within the Earth's atmosphere. The study entails understanding the state of the Earth's atmosphere, how it is changing over time and why. Understanding how various weather events develop and evolve is often conducted through retrospective analysis of past atmospheric events. Atmospheric scientists can then utilize tools to better predict potential hazards and provide earlier warnings for events that may impact life and property. Several atmospheric state variables can be measured to identify high-impact events, one of which is surface atmospheric pressure. Many weather events are characterized by variations in surface pressure from the mean pressure value (i.e., pressure-perturbations). Accordingly, there is significant interest in extracting and tracking pressure-perturbations both spatially and temporally to better understand the evolution of weather events. Here, we present a visualization and analysis environment that allows interactive exploration of pressure-perturbation data sets. Our system, for the first time, enables atmospheric scientists to interactively explore the spatiotemporal behaviors of pressure-perturbations for a range of values and provides support to leverage other conventional data sets such as radar imagery and wind observations. It also allows atmospheric scientists to evaluate model and parameter sensitivity, which is difficult if not impossible with conventional visualization tools in atmospheric sciences. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our approach for retrospective analysis using different case studies of recorded severe weather events.",E.1 [Data Structures]: Graphs and Networksâ€”;J.2 [Physical Sciences and Engineering]: Earth and Atmospheric Sciencesâ€”

Visual-analytics techniques using raw data sets are often expensive due to the data sets' extreme sizes. But, interactive analysis and visualization is crucial for big data analytics, because scientists can then focus on the important data and make critical decisions quickly. To assist efficient exploration and visualization, we propose a new region-based statistical data summarization scheme. Our method is superior in quality, as compared to the existing statistical summarization techniques, with a more compact representation, reducing the overall storage cost. The quantitative and visual efficacy of our proposed method is demonstrated using several data sets along with an in situ application study for an extreme-scale flow simulation.",I.3 [COMPUTER GRAPHICS]: Picture/Image Generationâ€”Display algorithms;G.3 [PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS]: Distribution functionsâ€”Statistical computing
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,Efficient distribution-based feature search in multi-field datasets,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Local distribution search is used in query-driven visualization for identifying salient features. Due to the high computational and storage costs, local distribution search in multi-field datasets is challenging. In this paper, we introduce two high performance, memory efficient algorithms for searching for local distributions that are characterized by marginal and joint features in multi-field datasets. They leverage bitmap indexing and local voting to efficiently extract regions that match a target distribution, by first approximating search results and refining to generate the final result. The first algorithm, merged-bin-comparison (MBC), reduces the computation of histogram dissimilarity measures by clustering bins.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,SwiftTuna: Responsive and incremental visual exploration of large-scale multidimensional data,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"For interactive exploration of large-scale data, a preprocessing scheme (e.g., data cubes) has often been used to summarize the data and provide low-latency responses. However, such a scheme suffers from a prohibitively large amount of memory footprint as more dimensions are involved in querying, and a strong prerequisite that specific data structures have to be built from the data before querying. In this paper, we present SwiftTuna, a holistic system that streamlines the visual information seeking process on large-scale multidimensional data. SwiftTuna exploits an in-memory computing engine, Apache Spark, to achieve both scalability and performance without building precomputed data structures. We also present a novel interactive visualization technique, tailed charts, to facilitate large-scale multidimensional data exploration. To support responsive querying on large-scale data, SwiftTuna leverages an incremental processing approach, providing immediate low-fidelity responses (i.e., prompt responses) as well as delayed high-fidelity responses (i.e., incremental responses). Our performance evaluation demonstrates that SwiftTuna allows data exploration of a real-world dataset with four billion records while preserving the latency between incremental responses within a few seconds.",Information visualization;exploratory analysis;large-scale data exploration;scalability;incremental visualization
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,Multivariate volumetric data analysis and visualization through bottom-up subspace exploration,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Multivariate volumetric datasets are often encountered in results generated by scientific simulations. Compared to univariate datasets, analysis and visualization of multivariate datasets are much more challenging due to the complex relationships among the variables. As an effective way to visualize and analyze multivariate datasets, volume rendering has been frequently used, although designing good multivariate transfer functions is still non-trivial. In this paper, we present an interactive workflow to allow users to design multivariate transfer functions. To handle large scale datasets, in the preprocessing stage we reduce the number of data points through data binning and aggregation, and then a new set of data points with a much smaller size are generated. The relationship between all pairs of variables is presented in a matrix juxtaposition view, where users can navigate through the different subspaces. An entropy based method is used to help users to choose which subspace to explore. We proposed two weights: scatter weight and size weight that are associated with each projected point in those different subspaces. Based on those two weights, data point filter and kernel density estimation operations are employed to assist users to discover interesting features. For each user-selected feature, a Gaussian function is constructed and updated incrementally. Finally, all those selected features are visualized through multivariate volume rendering to reveal the structure of data. With our system, users can interactively explore different subspaces and specify multivariate transfer functions in an effective way. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system with several multivariate volumetric datasets.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,Range likelihood tree: A compact and effective representation for visual exploration of uncertain data sets,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Uncertain data visualization plays a fundamental role in many applications such as weather forecast and analysis of fluid flows. Exploring scalar uncertain data modeled as probability distribution fields is a challenging task because the underlying features are often more complex, and the data associated with each grid point are high dimensional. In this work, we present a compact and effective representation, called range likelihood tree, to summarize and explore probability distribution fields. The key idea is to decompose and summarize each complex probability distribution over a few representative subranges by cumulative probabilities, and allow users to consider the roles that different subranges play in understanding the probability distributions. In our method, the value domain is first partitioned into subranges, then the distribution at each grid point is transformed according to the cumulative probabilities of the point's distribution in those subranges. Organizing the subranges into a hierarchical structure based on how these cumulative probabilities are spatially distributed in the grid points, the new range likelihood tree representation allows effective classification and identification of features through user query and exploration. We present an exploration framework with multiple interactive views to explore probability distribution fields, and provide guidelines for visual exploration using our framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our approach in exploratory analysis using several representative uncertain data sets.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,Statistical visualization and analysis of large data using a value-based spatial distribution,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"The size of large-scale scientific datasets created from simulations and computed on modern supercomputers continues to grow at a fast pace. A daunting challenge is to analyze and visualize these intractable datasets on commodity hardware. A recent and promising area of research is to replace the dataset with a distribution based proxy representation that summarizes scalar information into a much reduced memory footprint. Proposed representations subdivide the dataset into local blocks, where each block holds important statistical information, such as a histogram. A key drawback is that a distribution representing the scalar values in a block lacks spatial information. This manifests itself as large errors in visualization algorithms. We present a novel statistically-based representation by augmenting the block-wise distribution based representation with location information, called a value-based spatial distribution. Information from both spatial and scalar spaces are combined using Bayes' rule to accurately estimate the data value at a given spatial location. The representation is compact using the Gaussian Mixture Model. We show that our approach is able to preserve important features in the data and alleviate uncertainty.",

We propose a novel TF design toolbox based on color similarity which is used to adjust opacity as well as replacing colors. We show that both CIE L*u*v* chromaticity and the chroma component of YCBCR are equally suited as underlying color space for the TF widgets. In order to maximize the area utilized in the TF editor, we renormalize the color space based on the histogram of the dataset. Thereby, colors representing a higher share of the dataset are depicted more prominently, thus providing a higher sensitivity for fine-tuning TF widgets. The applicability of our TF design toolbox is demonstrated by volume ray casting challenging full-color volume data including the visible male cryosection dataset and examples from 3D histology.",Computer Graphics [I.3.3]: Picture/Image Generationâ€”Display algorithms;Computer Graphics [I.3.6]: Methodology and Techniques;Computer Graphics [I.3.7]: Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism;Computer Graphics [I.3.8]: Applications

Our approach first replaces exact isosurface extraction with a binary volume indicating whether each voxel intersects the surface or not. We then employ bounding volume hierarchy (BVH)-trees to speed up the distance field computation. Finally, a self-similarity map is generated from which we identify representative isosurfaces. We apply our approach to compute isosurface similarity maps from different volume data sets of varying sizes and characteristics. The results demonstrate significant speed gain with acceptable loss of accuracy, showing the potential of our solution for handling large-scale time-varying multivariate data sets.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,Using interactive particle-based rendering to visualize a large-scale time-varying unstructured volume with mixed cell types,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"The primary challenge in the visualization of a large-scale unstructured volume data with mixed cell types is to dissolve a bottleneck caused by visibility sorting of unstructured cells. In this paper, we implement an interactive particle-based rendering method to solve this complex visualization problem. This technique uses opaque particles as the proxy geometry of the mixed unstructured cells so that the visibility sorting process is not needed. This characteristic makes the rendering of mixed-cell unstructured volume efficient. We also construct a resizing function to adjust the particle radius depending on the assigned transfer function so that the transfer function can be adjusted in real time. Furthermore, we develop a time-varying level-of-detail (LOD) rendering to efficiently handle the large-scale time-varying data. This LOD rendering can provide high-speed rendering for animation rendering and high-quality rendering when the animation is stopped at any time step of interest. These features facilitate the detailed analysis of the temporal features of the data.",unstructured volume;large-scale visualization;mixed cell;time-varying visualization

We present a new technique that improves on both above points, in terms of increasing both the scalability and computational speed of bundling, while keeping the quality of the results on par with state-of-the-art techniques. For this, we shift the bundling process from the image space to the spectral (frequency) space, thereby increasing computational speed. We address scalability by proposing a data streaming process that allows bundling of extremely large datasets with limited GPU memory.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,Visualizing the uncertainty induced by graph layout algorithms,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Given a graph structure, different layout algorithms (even different settings of the same algorithm) usually result in different arrangements of vertices, and each layout may reflect certain aspects/parts of the graph more accurately than others. Thus, for high-level graph analysis tasks that rely on the overall arrangement of vertices, drawing conclusions only from one layout is risky. To alleviate the risk, we propose an ensemble framework to capture the commonalities and differences among possible layouts, and help users obtain a comprehensive view of the structure patterns. We leverage a set of layouts that represents the distribution of algorithm outputs. Then, visual features are extracted and analyzed based on various measures of visual similarity. Our framework supports users to analyze individual layouts in the context of the distribution, so that users can quickly identify structures of interest and discover patterns more accurately and comprehensively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to three datasets.",Graph visualization;layout uncertainty;layout algorithm;visual feature;graph layout;uncertainty visualization

IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,Quasi-biclique edge concentration: A visual analytics method for biclustering,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Biclustering is a well-known approach for data mining, and it is applied in many fields, such as genome analyses, security services, and social network analyses. Biclustering finds bicliques contained in a bipartite graph. However, in real data, a biclique may lack several edges because of various reasons, such as errors. In this situation, traditional biclustering methods cannot find correct biclusters. A novel biclustering method that can analyze real data under uncertainty is needed. Quasi-biclique is a mathematical concept that represents incomplete bicliques. We propose the quasi-biclique edge concentration (QBEC) method, which is a visual analysis method for biclustering using quasi-biclique mining. QBEC includes visual representations and user interactions for quasi-bicliques. Quasi-bicliques contained in a bipartite graph are represented based on edge concentration. The incompleteness of a quasi-biclique is reflected in edge opacity. Users can interactively explore data by adjusting the incompleteness parameter of the quasi-biclique.

Our visual analytics interface, Aeonium, supports human insight in collaborative coding through visual overviews of codes assigned by multiple researchers and distributions of important keywords and codes. The underlying machine learning model highlights ambiguity and inconsistency. Our goal was not to reduce qualitative coding to a machine-solvable problem, but rather to bolster human understanding gained from coding and reinterpreting the data collaboratively. We conducted an experimental study with 39 participants who coded tweets using our interface. In addition to increased understanding of the topic, participants reported that Aeonium's collaborative coding functionality helped them reflect on their own interpretations.

Using this design space, we designed and developed ChartAccent, a tool that allows people to quickly and easily augment charts via a palette of annotation interactions that generate manual and data-driven annotations. We also report on a study in which participants reproduced a series of annotated charts using ChartAccent, beginning with unadorned versions of the same charts.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,"A visual analytics system for brain functional connectivity comparison across individuals, groups, and time points",PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Neuroscientists study brain functional connectivity in order to obtain a deeper understanding of how the brain functions. Current studies are mainly based on analyzing the averaged brain connectivity of a group (or groups) due to the high complexity of the collected data in terms of dimensionality, variability, and volume.

In this paper, we present the design and capabilities of such a visual analytics system, which enables neuroscientists to visually compare the differences of brain networks between individual subjects as well as group averages, to explore a large dataset and examine sub-groups of participants that may not have been expected a priori to be of interest, to review detailed information as needed, and to manipulate the data and views to fit their analytical needs with easy interactions.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,DrugPathSeeker: Interactive UI for exploring drug-ADR relation via pathways,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Biological interpretation and understanding of machine learning based predictive models are highly desirable in healthcare analytics. Predicting Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) is extremely important for safe and precision medicine. There are various machine learning based approaches to predict adverse reactions for drugs.

We propose DrugPathSeeker, a novel interactive user interface that integrates the machine learning model, database query API, statistical analysis, and visualization for exploring and understanding of the association between drugs and ADRs. The proposed UI can take a query drug, and provide a visual interface designed to support exploration of the predictions from the machine learning model for further understanding and interpretation. DrugPathSeeker uses a machine learning model, Small Molecular Risk Profiler, to make ADR predictions for a given drug. The visualization uses Sankey type flow diagrams for highlighting the relation between the drugs and ADRs.

Since interactive rendering usually relies on fast local lighting, the spatial arrangement of the spheres is often very hard to perceive.

In this work, we present Implicit Sphere Shadow Maps (ISSM), an application-tailored approach for large, dynamic particle data sets.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,Compression and shifting to reduce occlusion in multiple short time series,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Visualization of multiple time series often suffers from overplotting, making it difficult to read the values of curves that are hidden by other curves. We present techniques for horizontally displacing the endpoints of line segments in discrete time series data that (1) enable the depiction of subsets of data and (2) reduce occlusion of endpoints. Because endpoints are not displaced vertically, their y values can still be read and compared. Unlike small multiples, our techniques do not move points with the same x or y values far from each other, making some comparison tasks easier. We present three novel techniques: compressed-superposed, compressed-juxtaposed, and shifted layers. One limitation of our techniques is that they work best when there is only a small number of x values being visualized, and additionally, one of them (compressed-superposed) modifies the slopes of curves in a way that makes the slopes incomparable. Our experimental comparison with three status quo techniques (conventional overlaid, vertically-stacked small multiples, and horizontally-stacked small multiples) shows that our proposed techniques are competitive with status quo techniques and in some cases superior.",I.3.6 [Computer Graphics]: Methodology and Techniquesâ€”Interaction techniques

IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,Radial contour labeling with straight leaders,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"The usefulness of technical drawings as well as scientific illustrations such as medical drawings of human anatomy essentially depends on the placement of labels that describe all relevant parts of the figure. In order to not spoil or clutter the figure with text, the labels are often placed around the figure and are associated by thin connecting lines to their features, respectively. This labeling technique is known as external label placement. In this paper we introduce a flexible and general approach for external label placement assuming a contour of the figure prescribing the possible positions of the labels. While much research on external label placement aims for fast labeling procedures for interactive systems, we focus on highest-quality illustrations. Based on interviews with domain experts and a semi-automatic analysis of 202 handmade anatomical drawings, we identify a set of 18 layout quality criteria, naturally not all of equal importance. We design a new geometric label placement algorithm that is based only on the most important criteria. Yet, other criteria can flexibly be included in the algorithm, either as hard constraints not to be violated or as soft constraints whose violation is penalized by a general cost function. We formally prove that our approach yields labelings that satisfy all hard constraints and have minimum overall cost. Introducing several speedup techniques, we further demonstrate how to deploy our approach in practice. In an experimental evaluation on real-world anatomical drawings we show that the resulting labelings are of high quality and can be produced in adequate time.",F.2.2 [Theory of Computation]: Nonnumerical Algorithms and Problemsâ€”Geometrical problems and computations;J.3 [Computer Applications]: Life and Medical Sciencesâ€”Medical information systems
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,Making many-to-many parallel coordinate plots scalable by asymmetric biclustering,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Datasets obtained through recently advanced measurement techniques tend to possess a large number of dimensions. This leads to explosively increasing computation costs for analyzing such datasets, thus making formulation and verification of scientific hypotheses very difficult. Therefore, an efficient approach to identifying feature subspaces of target datasets, that is, the subspaces of dimension variables or subsets of the data samples, is required to describe the essence hidden in the original dataset. This paper proposes a visual data mining framework for supporting semiautomatic data analysis that builds upon asymmetric biclustering to explore highly correlated feature subspaces. For this purpose, a variant of parallel coordinate plots, many-to-many parallel coordinate plots, is extended to visually assist appropriate selections of feature subspaces as well as to avoid intrinsic visual clutter. In this framework, biclustering is applied to dimension variables and data samples of the dataset simultaneously and asymmetrically. A set of variable axes are projected to a single composite axis while data samples between two consecutive variable axes are bundled using polygonal strips. This makes the visualization method scalable and enables it to play a key role in the framework. The effectiveness of the proposed framework has been empirically proven, and it is remarkably useful for many-to-many parallel coordinate plots.",

IEEE,conferencePaper,2016,Keynote speaker: Visualization analysis and design,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Summary form only given. Computer-based visualization (vis) systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively. Visualization is suitable when there is a need to augment human capabilities rather than replace people with computational decision-making methods. The design space of possible vis idioms is huge, and includes the considerations of both how to create and how to interact with visual representations. Vis design is full of trade-offs, and most possibilities in the design space are ineffective for a particular task, so validating the effectiveness of a design is both necessary and difficult. Vis designers must take into account three very different kinds of resource limitations: those of computers, of humans, and of displays. Vis usage can be analyzed in terms of why the user needs it, what data is shown, and how the idiom is designed. I will discuss this framework for analyzing the design of visualization systems.",

IEEE,conferencePaper,2016,Mathematical foundations of arc length-based aspect ratio selection,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"The aspect ratio of a plot can strongly influence the perception of trends in the data. Arc length based aspect ratio selection (AL) has demonstrated many empirical advantages over previous methods. However, it is still not clear why and when this method works. In this paper, we attempt to unravel its mystery by exploring its mathematical foundation. First, we explain the rationale why this method is parameterization invariant and follow the same rationale to extend previous methods which are not parameterization invariant. As such, we propose maximizing weighted local curvature (MLC), a parameterization invariant form of local orientation resolution (LOR) and reveal the theoretical connection between average slope (AS) and resultant vector (RV). Furthermore, we establish a mathematical connection between AL and banking to 45 degrees and derive the upper and lower bounds of its average absolute slopes. Finally, we conduct a quantitative comparison that revises the understanding of aspect ratio selection methods in three aspects: (1) showing that AL, AWO and RV always perform very similarly while MS is not; (2) demonstrating the advantages in the robustness of RV over AL; (3) providing a counterexample where all previous methods produce poor results while MLC works well.",I.3.7 [Computing Methodologies]: Computer Graphics â€” Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism

IEEE,conferencePaper,2016,Interactive visual co-cluster analysis of bipartite graphs,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"A bipartite graph models the relation between two different types of entities. It is applicable, for example, to describe persons' affiliations to different social groups or their association with subjects such as topics of interest. In these applications, it is important to understand the connectivity patterns among the entities in the bipartite graph. For the example of a bipartite relation between persons and their topics of interest, people may form groups based on their common interests, and the topics also can be grouped or categorized based on the interested audiences. Co-clustering methods can identify such connectivity patterns and find clusters within the two types of entities simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an interactive visualization design that incorporates co-clustering methods to facilitate the identification of node clusters formed by their common connections in a bipartite graph. Besides highlighting the automatically detected node clusters and the connections among them, the visual interface also provides visual cues for evaluating the homogeneity of the bipartite connections in a cluster, identifying potential outliers, and analyzing the correlation of node attributes with the cluster structure. The interactive visual interface allows users to flexibly adjust the node grouping to incorporate their prior knowledge of the domain, either by direct manipulation (i.e., splitting and merging the clusters), or by providing explicit feedback on the cluster quality, based on which the system will learn a parametrization of the co-clustering algorithm to better align with the users' notion of node similarity. To demonstrate the utility of the system, we present two example usage scenarios on real world datasets.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2016,A crowdsourcing system for integrated and reproducible evaluation in scientific visualization,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"User evaluations have gained increasing importance in visualization research over the past years, as in many cases these evaluations are the only way to support the claims made by visualization researchers. Unfortunately, recent literature reviews show that in comparison to algorithmic performance evaluations, the number of user evaluations is still very low. Reasons for this are the required amount of time to conduct such studies together with the difficulties involved in participant recruitment and result reporting. While it could be shown that the quality of evaluation results and the simplified participant recruitment of crowdsourcing platforms makes this technology a viable alternative to lab experiments when evaluating visualizations, the time for conducting and reporting such evaluations is still very high. In this paper, we propose a software system, which integrates the conduction, the analysis and the reporting of crowdsourced user evaluations directly into the scientific visualization development process. With the proposed system, researchers can conduct and analyze quantitative evaluations on a large scale through an evaluation-centric user interface with only a few mouse clicks. Thus, it becomes possible to perform iterative evaluations during algorithm design, which potentially leads to better results, as compared to the time consuming user evaluations traditionally conducted at the end of the design process. Furthermore, the system is built around a centralized database, which supports an easy reuse of old evaluation designs and the reproduction of old evaluations with new or additional stimuli, which are both driving challenges in scientific visualization research. We will describe the system's design and the considerations made during the design process, and demonstrate the system by conducting three user evaluations, all of which have been published before in the visualization literature.",H.3.4.1 [Information Systems]: Systems and Software â€” Performance evaluation (efficiency and effectiveness);I.3.7 [Computer Graphics]: Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism â€” Color;shading;shadowing;texture
IEEE,conferencePaper,2016,"An integrated visualization system for interactive analysis of large, heterogeneous cosmology data",PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Cosmological simulations produce a multitude of data types whose large scale makes them difficult to thoroughly explore in an interactive setting. One aspect of particular interest to scientists is the evolution of groups of dark matter particles, or ""halos,"" described by merger trees. However, in order to fully understand subtleties in the merger trees, other data types derived from the simulation must be incorporated as well. In this work, we develop a novel interactive linked-view visualization system that focuses on simultaneously exploring dark matter halos, their hierarchical evolution, corresponding particle data, and other quantitative information. We employ a parallel remote renderer and a local merger tree selection tool so that users can analyze large data sets interactively. This allows scientists to assess their simulation code, understand inconsistencies in extracted data, and intuitively understand simulation behavior on all scales. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through a set of case studies on large-scale cosmological data from the HACC (Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code) simulation framework.",I.6.4 [Simulation and Modeling]: Simulation Output Analysis;J.2 [Physical Sciences and Engineering]: Astronomy
IEEE,conferencePaper,2016,EnsembleGraph: Interactive visual analysis of spatiotemporal behaviors in ensemble simulation data,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"This paper presents a novel visual analysis tool, EnsembleGraph, which aims at helping scientists understand spatiotemporal similarities across runs in time-varying ensemble simulation data. We abstract the input data into a graph, where each node represents a region with similar behaviors across runs and nodes in adjacent time frames are linked if their regions overlap spatially. The visualization of this graph, combined with multiple-linked views showing details, enables users to explore, select, and compare the extracted regions that have similar behaviors. The driving application of this paper is the study of regional emission influences over tropospheric ozone, based on the ensemble simulations conducted with different anthropogenic emission absences using MOZART-4. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by visualizing the MOZART-4 ensemble simulation data and evaluating the relative regional emission influences on tropospheric ozone concentrations.",ensemble simulation;graph visualization
IEEE,conferencePaper,2016,Rethinking sensitivity analysis of nuclear simulations with topology,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In nuclear engineering, understanding the safety margins of the nuclear reactor via simulations is arguably of paramount importance in predicting and preventing nuclear accidents. It is therefore crucial to perform sensitivity analysis to understand how changes in the model inputs affect the outputs. Modern nuclear simulation tools rely on numerical representations of the sensitivity information â€” inherently lacking in visual encodings â€” offering limited effectiveness in communicating and exploring the generated data. In this paper, we design a framework for sensitivity analysis and visualization of multidimensional nuclear simulation data using partition-based, topology-inspired regression models and report on its efficacy. We rely on the established Morse-Smale regression technique, which allows us to partition the domain into monotonic regions where easily interpretable linear models can be used to assess the influence of inputs on the output variability. The underlying computation is augmented with an intuitive and interactive visual design to effectively communicate sensitivity information to nuclear scientists. Our framework is being deployed into the multipurpose probabilistic risk assessment and uncertainty quantification framework RAVEN (Reactor Analysis and Virtual Control Environment). We evaluate our framework using a simulation dataset studying nuclear fuel performance.",Sensitivity analysis;uncertainty;nuclear simulation;computational topology
IEEE,conferencePaper,2016,Topology-inspired Galilean invariant vector field analysis,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Vector field topology is one of the most powerful flow visualization tools, because it can break down huge amounts of data into a compact, sparse, and easy to read description with little information loss. It suffers from one main drawback though: The definition of critical points, which is the foundation of vector field topology, is highly dependent on the frame of reference. In this paper we propose to consider every point as a critical point and locally adjust the frame of reference to the most persistent ones, that means the extrema of the determinant of the Jacobian. The result is not the extraction of one well-suited frame of reference, but the simultaneous visualization of the dominating frames of reference in the different areas of the flow field. Each of them could individually be perceived by an observer traveling along these critical points. We show all important ones at once.",

By taking longer access sequences into account to model more sophisticated data access patterns in particle tracing, our method greatly improves the accuracy and reliability in data access prediction. In our work, high-order access dependencies are calculated by tracing uniformly seeded pathlines in both forward and backward directions in a preprocessing stage. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through a parallel particle tracing framework with high-order data prefetching. Results show that our method achieves higher data locality and hence improves the efficiency of pathline computation.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2016,Comparative visualization of multiple time surfaces by planar surface reformation,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Comparing time surfaces at different integration time points, or from different seeding areas, can provide valuable insight into transport phenomena of fluid flows. Such a comparative study is challenging due to the often convoluted shapes of these surfaces. We propose a new approach for comparative flow visualization based on time surfaces, which exploits the idea of embedding the surfaces in a carefully designed, reformed 2D visualization space. Such an embedding enables new opportunities for comparative flow visualization. We present three different strategies for comparative flow visualization that take advantage of the reformation. By reforming the time surfaces, we not only mitigate occlusion issues, but we can devote also the third dimension of the visualization space to the comparative aspects of the visualization. Our approach is effective in a variety of flow study cases. The direct comparison of individual time surfaces reveals small scale differences and fine details about the fluid's motion. The concurrent study of multiple surface families enables the identification and the comparison of the most prominent motion patterns.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2016,Comparative visualization of vector field ensembles based on longest common subsequence,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"We propose a longest common subsequence (LCSS)-based approach to compute the distance among vector field ensembles. By measuring how many common blocks the ensemble pathlines pass through, the LCSS distance defines the similarity among vector field ensembles by counting the number of shared domain data blocks. Compared with traditional methods (e.g., pointwise Euclidean distance or dynamic time warping distance), the proposed approach is robust to outliers, missing data, and the sampling rate of the pathline timesteps. Taking advantage of smaller and reusable intermediate output, visualization based on the proposed LCSS approach reveals temporal trends in the data at low storage cost and avoids tracing pathlines repeatedly. We evaluate our method on both synthetic data and simulation data, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed approach.",

In this paper, we study the problem of cavity extraction in biomolecules while taking into account such uncertainties. We propose an approach that connects user-specified cavities by computing an optimal conduit within the region occupied by the molecule. The conduit is computed using a topological representation of the occupied and empty regions and is guaranteed to satisfy well defined geometric optimality criteria.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2016,Accelerated visualization of transparent molecular surfaces in molecular dynamics,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"The reactivity of the biomolecular structures is highly influenced by their structural features. Thus, studying these features along with the exploration of their dynamic behavior helps to understand the processes ongoing in living cells. This can be reached by the visual representation of these processes as visualization is one of the most natural ways to convey such information. However, none of the currently available techniques provides the biochemists with an intuitive real-time representation of the dynamic movements of molecules and precise geometrical based extraction of their structural features performed instantly. In this paper we introduce such a technique enabling the user to compute and also to visualize the molecular surface along with inner voids. To obtain a better insight into the molecule, our technique enables to visualize the molecular surface transparently. The opacity can be adjusted by changing user-defined parameters in order to enhance the perception of the surfaces of inner voids. All integrated algorithms run in real-time which gives the user a big variety of exploration possibilities.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2016,Interactive exploration of atomic trajectories through relative-angle distribution and associated uncertainties,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Exploration of atomic trajectories is fundamental to understanding and characterizing complex chemical systems important in many applications. For instance, any new insight into the mechanisms of ionic migration in catalytic materials could lead to a substantial increase in battery performance. A new statistical measure, called the relative-angle distribution, has been proposed to understand complex motion - whether Brownian, ballistic, or diffusive. The relative-angle distribution can be represented as a collection of 1D histograms, but is currently created in a slow, offline process, making any parameter exploration a tedious and time-consuming task. Furthermore, the resulting plot can hide uncertainty in both the data and the visualization. As a result, once rastered or printed at a fixed resolution, these histograms can be misleading. We present a new analysis tool for the exploration of atomic trajectories that combines an interactive histogram visualization with uncertainty information for both data and plotting errors, and is also linked to an interactive 3D display of trajectories. Our tool enables a holistic exploration of trajectories previously not feasible, with the potential for significant scientific impact. In collaboration with domain experts, we have deployed our tool ta analyze molecular dynamics simulations of lithium-ion diffusion. Users have found that the tool significantly accelerates the exploration process and have used it to validate a number of previously unconfirmed hypotheses.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2016,Dimension reconstruction for visual exploration of subspace clusters in high-dimensional data,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Subspace-based analysis has increasingly become the preferred method for clustering high-dimensional data. A visually interactive exploration of subspaces and clusters is a cyclic process. Every meaningful discovery will motivate users to re-search subspaces that can provide improved clustering results and reveal the relationships among clusters that can hardly coexist in the original subspaces. However, the combination of dimensions from the original subspaces is not always effective in finding the expected subspaces. In this study, we present an approach that enables users to reconstruct new dimensions from the data projections of subspaces to preserve interesting cluster information. The reconstructed dimensions are included into an analytical workflow with the original dimensions to help users construct target-oriented subspaces which clearly display informative cluster structures. We also provide a visualization tool that assists users in the exploration of subspace clusters by utilizing dimension reconstruction. Several case studies on synthetic and real-world data sets have been performed to prove the effectiveness of our approach.

To address this problem, we propose a novel visual analytics approach to logistic regression modeling for high-dimensional datasets. It leverages the traditional modeling pipeline by providing (1) intuitive visualizations for inspecting statistical indicators and the relationships among the variables and (2) a seamless, effective dimension reduction pipeline for selecting variables for inclusion in high quality logistic regression models.

Nowadays many text-based data sets, such as Flickr tags, are geo-referenced, that is, they have an important spatial component. However, existing automated methods to generate word clouds are unable to incorporate such spatial information. We introduce geo word clouds: word clouds which capture not only the frequency but also the spatial relevance of words. Our input is a set of locations from one (or more) geographic regions with (possibly several) text labels per location. We aggregate word frequencies according to point clusters and employ a greedy strategy to place appropriately sized labels without overlap as close as possible to their corresponding locations. While doing so we ""draw"" the spatial shapes of the geographic regions with the corresponding labels. We experimentally explore trade-offs concerning the location of labels, their relative sizes and the number of spatial clusters. The resulting word clouds are visually pleasing and have a low error in terms of relative scaling and locational accuracy of words, while using a small number of clusters per label.",I.3.3 [Computer Graphics]: Picture/Image Generation

We identified images, attributes, and categories as important aspects and integrated these in a system called ICLIC. The system consists of four views that are connected by the selection of images, which is a central action in the approach. By using a minimalist interface with only standard metaphors, users are enabled to use the system in short time.

Edge bundling techniques have been proposed to solve cluttering issue for standard graphs while few efforts were done to deal with the similar issue for multilayer graphs. In multilayer graphs scenario, not only the clutter induced by large amount of edges is a problem but also the fact that different type of edges can overlap each other making useless the final visualization. In this paper we introduce a new multilayer graph edge bundling technique that firstly produces a preliminary edge bundling independently of the different edge layers and then deals with the specificity of multilayer graphs where more than one type of edges can be routed on the same bundle.

Attempts have been made to investigate the usability of curved drawings. However, the results on the effect of curves per se on human graph comprehension has not been conclusive. This paper presents a user study that is to examine the effect of curves when they are introduced to remove crossings. Twenty-six participants were recruited to perform typical graph reading tasks.

We propose a scheme to visualize the spatial variations of isosurfaces with respect to statistically significant isosurfaces within the ensemble. Understanding such variations among ensemble of isosurfaces at different spatial regions is helpful in analyzing the influence of different ensemble runs over the spatial domain.

In this work, we present a novel probabilistic method for streamline computation on uncertain steady vector fields using a Bayesian framework. In our framework, a streamline is modeled as a state space model which captures the spatial coherence of integration steps and uncertainty in local distributions using the conditional prior density and the likelihood function. To approximate the posterior distribution for all the possible traces originating from a given seed position, a set of weighted samples are iteratively updated from which streamlines with higher likelihood can be derived.

However, when the number of time series becomes very large, the layers representing time series with small values take up only very small proportions in the stacked graph, making them hard to trace. As a result, it is challenging for analysts to detect the correlation of individual layers and their aggregation, and find trend similarities and differences between layers solely with stacked graphs. In this paper, we study the correlations of individual layers, and their aggregation in time series data presented with stacked graphs, focusing on the local regions within any given time intervals. Specifically, we present STAC, an interactive visual analytics system, to help analysts gain insights into the correlations in stacked graphs.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Keynote speaker,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Summary form only given. In the last decades imaging modalities have advanced beyond recognition and data of rapidly increasing size and quality can be captured with high speed. This talk will show how data visualization can be used to provide public visitor venues, such as museums, science centers and zoos with unique interactive learning experiences. By combining data visualization techniques with technologies such as interactive multi-touch tables and intuitive user interfaces, visitors can conduct guided browsing of large volumetric image data. The visitors then themselves become the explorers of the normally invisible interior of unique artifacts and subjects. The talk will take its starting point in the current state-of-the-art in CT and MRI scanning technology. It will then discuss the latest high-quality interactive volume rendering and multi-resolution techniques for large scale data and how they are tailored for use in public spaces. Examples will then be shown of how the inside workings of the human body, exotic animals, natural history subjects, such as the martian meteorite, or even mummies can be explored interactively. The recent mummy installation at the British Museum will be shown and discussed from both a curator and visitor perspective and results from a 3 month trial period in the galleries will be presented.",

IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Interactive streamline exploration and manipulation using deformation,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Occlusion presents a major challenge in visualizing 3D flow fields using streamlines. Displaying too many streamlines creates a dense visualization filled with occluded structures, but displaying too few streams risks losing important features. A more ideal streamline exploration approach is to visually manipulate the cluttered streamlines by pulling visible layers apart and revealing the hidden structures underneath. This paper presents a customized deformation algorithm and an interactive visualization tool to minimize visual cluttering. The algorithm is able to maintain the overall integrity of the flow field and expose the previously hidden structures. Our system supports both mouse and direct-touch interactions to manipulate the viewing perspectives and visualize the streamlines in depth. By using a lens metaphor of different shapes to select the transition zone of the targeted area interactively, the users can move their focus and examine the flow field freely.",I.3.6 [Computer Graphics]: Methodology and Techniquesâ€”Interaction techniques;I.3.8 [Computer Graphics]: Applications
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Moment invariants for 3D flow fields via normalization,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"We generalize the framework of moments and introduce a definition of invariants for three-dimensional vector fields. To do so, we use the method of moment normalization that has been shown to be useful in the two dimensions. Using invariant moments, we show how to search for patterns in these fields independent from their position, orientation and scale. From the first order vector moment tensor, we construct a complete and independent set of descriptors. We test the invariants in queries on synthetic and real world flow fields.",I.4.7 [Image Processing and Computer Vision]: Feature Measurement â€”Moments;I.5.2 [Pattern Recognition]: Design Methodology â€”Classifier design and evaluation
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Surface flow visualization using the closest point embedding,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In this paper, we introduce a novel flow visualization technique for arbitrary surfaces. This new technique utilizes the closest point embedding to represent the surface, which allows for accurate particle advection on the surface as well as supports the unsteady flow line integral convolution (UFLIC) technique on the surface. This global approach is faster than previous parameterization techniques and prevents the visual artifacts associated with image-based approaches.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Parallel unsteady flow line integral convolution for high-performance dense visualization,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"This paper presents an accurate parallel implementation of unsteady flow line integral convolution (UFLIC) for high-performance visualization of large time-varying flows. Our approach differs from previous implementations by using a novel value scattering+gathering mechanism to parallelize UFLIC and designing a pathline reuse strategy to reduce the computational cost of pathline integration. By exploiting the massive parallelism of modern graphical processing units (GPU), the proposed method allows for real-time dense visualization of unsteady flows with high spatial-temporal coherence.",I.3.3 [Computer Graphics]: Pictures / Image Generation
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Dendrogramix: A hybrid tree-matrix visualization technique to support interactive exploration of dendrograms,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Clustering is often a first step when trying to make sense of a large data set. A wide family of cluster analysis algorithms, namely hierarchical clustering algorithms, does not provide a partition of the data set but a hierarchy of clusters organized in a binary tree, known as a dendrogram. The dendrogram has a classical node-link representation used by experts for various tasks like: to decide which subtrees are actual clusters (e.g., by cutting the dendrogram at a given depth); to give those clusters a name by inspecting their content; etc. We present Dendrogramix, a hybrid tree-matrix interactive visualization of dendrograms that superimposes the relationship between individual objects on to the hierarchy of clusters. Dendrogramix enables users to do tasks which involve both clusters and individual objects that are impracticable with the classical representation, like: to explain why a particular objects belongs to a particular cluster; to elicit and understand uncommon patterns (e.g., objects that could have been classified in a totally different cluster); etc. Those sensemaking tasks are supported by a consistent set of interaction techniques that facilitates the exploration of large clustering results.",Agglomerative hierarchical clustering;dendrogram;Dendrogramix;hybrid visualization;interaction
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Attribute-driven edge bundling for general graphs with applications in trail analysis,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Edge bundling methods reduce visual clutter of dense and occluded graphs. However, existing bundling techniques either ignore edge properties such as direction and data attributes, or are otherwise computationally not scalable, which makes them unsuitable for tasks such as exploration of large trajectory datasets. We present a new framework to generate bundled graph layouts according to any numerical edge attributes such as directions, timestamps or weights. We propose a GPU-based implementation linear in number of edges, which makes our algorithm applicable to large datasets. We demonstrate our method with applications in the analysis of aircraft trajectory datasets and eye-movement traces.",I.3.3 [Computing Methodologies]: Computer Graphicsâ€”Picture/Image Generation;I.3.6 [Computing Methodologies]: Computer Graphicsâ€”Methodology and Techniques
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Interactive visual summary of major communities in a large network,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In this paper, we introduce a novel visualization method which allows people to explore, compare and refine the major communities in a large network. We first detect major communities in a network using data mining and community analysis methods. Then, the statistics attributes of each community, the relational strength between communities, and the boundary nodes connecting those communities are computed and stored. We propose a novel method based on Voronoi treemap to encode each community with a polygon and the relative positions of polygons encode their relational strengths. Different community attributes can be encoded by polygon shapes, sizes and colors. A corner-cutting method is further introduced to adjust the smoothness of polygons based on certain community attribute. To accommodate the boundary nodes, the gaps between the polygons are widened by a polygon-shrinking algorithm such that the boundary nodes can be conveniently embedded into the newly created spaces. The method is very efficient, enabling users to test different community detection algorithms, fine tune the results, and explore the fuzzy relations between communities interactively. The case studies with two real data sets demonstrate that our approach can provide a visual summary of major communities in a large network, and help people better understand the characteristics of each community and inspect various relational patterns between communities.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Clustered edge routing,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"The classic method to depict graphs is a node-link diagram where vertices (nodes) are associated with each object and edges (links) connect related objects. However, node-link diagrams quickly appear cluttered and unclear, even for moderately sized graphs. If the positions of the nodes are fixed then suitable link routing is the only option to reduce clutter. We present a novel link clustering and routing algorithm which respects (and if desired refines) user-defined clusters on links. If no clusters are defined a priori we cluster based on geometric criteria, that is, based on a well-separated pair decomposition (WSPD).We route link clusters individually on a sparse visibility spanner. To completely avoid ambiguity we draw each individual link and ensure that clustered links follow the same path in the routing graph. We prove that the clusters induced by the WSPD consist of compatible links according to common similarity measures as formalized by Holten and van Wijk [17]. The greedy sparsification of the visibility graph allows us to easily route around obstacles. Our experimental results are visually appealing and convey a sense of abstraction and order.",I.3.5 [Computer Graphics]: Computational Geometry and Object Modeling
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Spherical layout and rendering methods for immersive graph visualization,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"While virtual reality has been researched in many ways for spatial and scientific visualizations, comparatively little has been explored for visualizations of more abstract kinds of data. In particular, stereoscopic and VR environments for graph visualization have only been applied as limited extensions to standard 2D techniques (e.g. using stereoscopy for highlighting). In this work, we explore a new, immersive approach for graph visualization, designed specifically for virtual reality environments.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Laplacian-based dynamic graph visualization,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Visualizing dynamic graphs are challenging due to the difficulty to preserving a coherent mental map of the changing graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel layout algorithm which is capable of maintaining the overall structure of a sequence graphs. Through Laplacian constrained distance embedding, our method works online and maintains the aesthetic of individual graphs and the shape similarity between adjacent graphs in the sequence. By preserving the shape of the same graph components across different time steps, our method can effectively help users track and gain insights into the graph changes. Two datasets are tested to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.",dynamic graph;graph layout algorithm;Laplican matrix;force directed layout;stress model

We present a visual analytic framework for dynamic multi-relational networks and a prototype implementation, called the MultiStory system, which includes two new visualisation methods, AlterCluster and InterArc, designed for dynamic networks with multiple relations. The system is evaluated with two case studies using social networks from the MIT Reality Commons to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system to support a variety of visual analytical tasks on dynamic multi-relational networks.",Visual Knowledge Discovery;Graph/Network Data;Time Series Data;Visualization in Social and Information Sciences

We present variational circular treemaps with a novel layout algorithm by solving disk packing as a continuous optimization problem. Our variational circular treemaps achieve higher space utilization ratio compared with the traditional circular treemaps and support natural interactions as focus+context distortions and drill-down and roll-up operations for data navigation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method for visualization and interaction.,Computer Graphics [I.3.5]: Computational Geometry and Object Modelingâ€”Object hierarchies
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,OD-Wheel: Visual design to explore OD patterns of a central region,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Understanding the Origin-Destination (OD) patterns between different regions of a city is important in urban planning. In this work, based on taxi GPS data, we propose OD-Wheel, a novel visual design and associated analysis tool, to explore OD patterns. Once users define a region, all taxi trips starting from or ending to that region are selected and grouped into OD clusters. With a hybrid circular-linear visual design, OD-Wheel allows users to explore the dynamic patterns of each OD cluster, including the variation of traffic flow volume and traveling time. The proposed tool supports convenient interactions and allows users to compare and correlate the patterns between different OD clusters. A use study with real data sets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed OD-Wheel.",H.5 [INFORMATION INTERFACES AND PRESENTATION]: User Interfacesâ€”Graphical user interfaces
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Analyzing delays in trajectories,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Interactions between trajectories need to be analyzed in various domains to gain insight into movement patterns. Such interactions often take place with some delayed response. We propose an approach to analyze and visualize delayed responses on two trajectories recorded simultaneously and with the same sampling rate. Central to our approach is the computation of a matching between the trajectories in a so-called delay space. We also introduce a new similarity measure between trajectories, which combines directional and spatial characteristics. To evaluate our approach experimentally, we have implemented it as a prototype visual analytics tool and have applied the tool on two datasets.",H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfacesâ€”Graphical user interfaces;H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfacesâ€”Interaction styles;I.5.3 [Pattern Recognition]: Clusteringâ€”Similarity measures

This paper proposes a set of glyphs named RoseShape that aim at improving users' visual information search in visualization. RoseShapes integrate rich and easy-to-catch attributes for mapping data variables, enabling automatic and unconscious information processing in the pre-attentive stage.

We developed ERICAs in order to enable chemists to analyze AIMD simulations of the interactions between two hydroxyl radicals in water. Consequently, we illustrate ERICAs using these simulations, and discuss how ERICAs can be generalized to other AIMD simulations. By using ERICAs, chemists have gained new insights into hydroxyl radical chemistry.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Extending Dimensions in Radviz based on mean shift,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Radviz is a radial visualization technique which maps data from multiple dimensional space onto a planar picture. The dimensions placed on the circumference of a circle, called Dimension Anchors (DAs), can be reordered to reveal different patterns in the dataset. Extending the number of dimensions can enhance the flexibility in the placement of the DAs to explore more meaningful visualizations. In this paper, we describe a method which rationally extends a dimension to multiple new dimensions in Radviz. This method first calculates the probability distribution histogram of a dimension. The mean shift algorithm is applied to get centers of probability density to segment the histogram, and then the dimension can be extended according to the number of segments of the histogram. We also suggest using the Dunn's index to find the optimal placement of DAs, so the better effect of visual clustering could be achieved after the dimension expansion in Radviz. Finally, we demonstrate the usability of our approach on visually analysing the iris data and two other datasets.",Information visualization;visual data mining;multidimensional data;Radviz;mean shift

In this paper, we present an interactive visual survey of text visualization techniques that can be used for the purposes of search for related work, introduction to the subfield and gaining insight into research trends. We describe the taxonomy used for categorization of text visualization techniques and compare it to approaches employed in several other surveys.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Visual exploration of Location-Based Social Networks data in urban planning,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"The increasing amount of data generated by Location Based Social Networks (LBSN) such as Twitter, Flickr, or Foursquare, is currently drawing the attention of urban planners, as it is a new source of data that contains valuable information about the behavior of the inhabitants of a city. Making this data accessible to the urban planning domain can add value to the decision making processes. However, the analysis of the spatial and temporal characteristics of this data in the context of urban planning is an ongoing research problem. This paper describes ongoing work in the design and development of a visual exploration tool to facilitate this task. The proposed design provides an approach towards the integration of a visual exploration tool and the capabilities of a visual query system from a multilevel perspective (e.g., multiple spatial scales and temporal resolutions implicit in LBSN data).

IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Application of Pareto sets in quality control of series production in car manufacturing,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In car manufacturing, quality management and control are important parts of the series process. In series production, many parts are controlled in various ways in some or all stages of assembly. While tactile measurements are mostly restricted to the points on an inspection plan, this restriction does not apply to optical measurements. We propose a method based on the theory of Pareto sets (multivariate topological analysis) to cope with the large amount of data produced by optical measurements and to find points of interest on the measured surface in addition to the inspection plan. We describe a method which automatically detects areas of systematic errors on a component and visualizes them on the triangulated surface. The visualization can help experts to decide, whether a detected feature is severe enough to be added to the inspection plan.",I.3.8 [Computer Methodologies]: Computer Graphicsâ€”Application;J.6 [Computer Applications]: Computeraided Engineering
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Visualizing 2D scalar fields with hierarchical topology,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"This paper describes an effort to create new visualizations by exploiting hierarchical scalar topology. First, we build a hierarchical topology through synchronously constructing and simplifying Contour Tree (CT) and Morse-Smale (MS) complex of scalar fields. We then introduce three algorithms based on the hierarchical topology: (1) topology-based multi-resolution contouring â€” an overview provided for a scalar field by extracting iso-values from the simplified CT and tracing approximate contours across the MS complex cells; (2) topology based spaghetti plots for uncertainty â€” a seeding scheme based on the hierarchical topology for visualizing uncertainty among ensemble scalar data; (3) virtual ribbons â€” a new scheme for visualizing multivariate data invented by overlapping visual ribbons which encode the scalar variation of a region covered by uniform contours. We compare the new approaches with current alternatives.",Scalar topology;contour tree;Morse-Smale complex;multivariate map;contouring;spaghetti plot
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Adaptive particle relaxation for time surfaces,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Time surfaces are a versatile tool to visualise advection and deformation in flow fields. Due to complex flow behaviours involving stretching, shearing, and folding, straightforward mesh-based representations of these surfaces can develop artefacts and degenerate quickly. Common counter-measures rely on refinement and adaptive insertion of new particles which lead to an unpredictable increase in memory requirements. We propose a novel time surface extraction technique that keeps the number of required flow particles constant, while providing a high level of fidelity and enabling straightforward load balancing. Our solution implements a 2D particle relaxation procedure that makes use of local surface metric tensors to model surface deformations. We combine this with an accurate bicubic surface representation to provide an artefact-free surface visualisation. We demonstrate and evaluate benefits of the proposed method with respect to surface accuracy and computational efficiency.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Computation-to-core mapping strategies for iso-surface volume rendering on GPUs,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Ray casting algorithm is a major component of the direct volume rendering, which exhibits inherent parallelism, making it suitable for graphics processing units (GPUs). However, blindly mapping the ray casting algorithm on a GPU's complex parallel architecture can result in a magnitude of performance loss. In this paper, a novel computation-to-core mapping strategy, called Warp Marching, for the texture-based iso-surface volume rendering is introduced. We evaluate and compare this new strategy with the most commonly used existing mapping strategy. Texture cache performance and load balancing are the two major evaluation factors since they have significant consequences on the overall rendering performance. Through a series of real-life data experiments, we conclude that the texture cache performances of these two computation-to-core mapping strategies are significantly affected by the viewing direction; and the Warp Marching performs better in balancing workloads among threads and concurrent hardware components of a GPU.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,VisMOOC: Visualizing video clickstream data from Massive Open Online Courses,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platforms are becoming increasingly popular in recent years. With thousands of students watching course videos, enormous amounts of clickstream data are produced and recorded by the MOOCs platforms for each course. Such large-scale data provide a great opportunity for instructors and educational analysts to gain insight into online learning behaviors on an unprecedented scale. Nevertheless, the growing scale and unique characteristics of the data also pose a special challenge for effective data analysis. In this paper, we introduce VisMOOC, a visual analytic system to help analyze user learning behaviors by using video clickstream data from MOOC platforms. We work closely with the instructors of two Coursera courses to understand the data and collect task analysis requirements. A complete user-centered design process is further employed to design and develop VisMOOC. It includes three main linked views: the List View to show an overview of the clickstream differences among course videos, the Content-based View to show temporal variations in the total number of each type of click action along the video timeline, the Dashboard View to show various statistical information such as demographic information and temporal information. We conduct two case studies with the instructors to demonstrate the usefulness of VisMOOC and discuss new findings on learning behaviors.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,TraVis - A visualization framework for mobile transect data sets in an urban microclimate context,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In urban microclimate research, mobile transects are utilized to observe the relationship between atmospheric variables and the urban environment. However, the data sets resulting from mobile measurements are complex: They are spatially dependent, multivariate, and often-times multitemporal. At the same time, the spatial context of each observation - its field of view and area represented - is physically complex and dynamic. These properties make analysis and visualization challenging. We present a prototype visualization framework that assists researchers in the analysis of mobile transect measurements. The system enables users to visualize and explore observations as walls that delineate the transect route on a map. The observed attributes are stacked upon each other within these walls as ribbons to facilitate the qualitative analysis of spatial variability and multivariate correlations. The relationship between observations and spatial context can interactively be explored by moving a slider along the transect route. For each observation on the track, the spatially contextual source area is displayed and linked to a view of the fraction of land cover classes contained within the source area. These qualitative analysis capabilities are complemented by an interactive clustering interface, which allows for the classification of transect segments according to a coherent pattern of multivariate relationships between a user-defined set of observations. The framework was developed by a team comprising both visualization and urban microclimate researchers, and a case study shows its utility for this specialized application.",I.3.8 [Computer Graphics]: Applicationsâ€”;J.2 [Computer Applications]: Earth and atmospheric sciencesâ€”
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,CloudGazer: A divide-and-conquer approach to monitoring and optimizing cloud-based networks,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"With the rise of virtualization and cloud-based networks of various scales and degrees of complexity, new approaches to managing such infrastructures are required. In these networks, relationships among components can be of arbitrary cardinality (1:1, 1:n, n:m), making it challenging for administrators to investigate which components influence others. In this paper we present CloudGazer, a scalable visualization system that allows users to monitor and optimize cloud-based networks effectively to reduce energy consumption and to increase the quality of service. Instead of visualizing the overall network, we split the graph into semantic perspectives that provide a much simpler view of the network. CloudGazer is a multiple coordinated view system that visualizes either static or live status information about the components of a perspective while reintroducing lost inter-perspective relationships on demand using dynamically created inlays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CloudGazer in two usage scenarios: The first is based on a real-world network of our domain partners where static performance parameters are used to find an optimal design. In the second scenario we use the VAST 2013 Challenge dataset to demonstrate how the system can be employed with live streaming data.",

IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,MetaTracts - A method for robust extraction and visualization of carbon fiber bundles in fiber reinforced composites,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"This work introduces MetaTracts, a novel method for extracting and visualizing individual fiber bundles and weaving patterns from X-ray computed tomography (XCT) scans of endless carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP). The proposed work flow is designed to analyze unit cells of CFRP materials integrating the recurring weaving pattern. It is designed to handle XCT scans of low resolution, in which individual fibers are not visible or are barely visible. First, a coarse version of integral curves is used to trace subsections of the individual fiber bundles in the woven CFRP materials. We call these sections MetaTracts. In the second step, these extracted fiber bundle sections (MetaTracts) are clustered using a two-step approach: first by orientation, then by proximity. The tool can generate volumetric representations as well as surface models of the extracted fiber bundles to be exported for further analysis. We evaluate the proposed work flow on a number of real world datasets and demonstrate that MetaTracts effectively and robustly identifies and separates different fiber bundles.",I.4.9 [IMAGE PROCESSING AND COMPUTER VISION]: Applications;I.3.8 [COMPUTER GRAPHICS]: Applications

IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Clutter-aware label layout,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"A high-quality label layout is critical for effective information understanding and consumption. Existing labeling methods fail to help users quickly gain an overview of visualized data when the number of labels is large. Visual clutter is a major challenge preventing these methods from being applied to real-world applications. To address this, we propose a context-aware label layout that can measure and reduce visual clutter during the layout process. Our method formulates the clutter model using four factors: confusion, visual connection, distance, and intersection. Based on this clutter model, an effective clutter-aware labeling method has been developed that can generate clear and legible label layouts in different visualizations. We have applied our method to several types of visualizations and the results show promise, especially in support of an uncluttered and informative label layout.",Visual clutter;clutter measure;label placement
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Uncertainty modeling and error reduction for pathline computation in time-varying flow fields,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"When the spatial and temporal resolutions of a time-varying simulation become very high, it is not possible to process or store data from every time step due to the high computation and storage cost. Although using uniformly down-sampled data for visualization is a common practice, important information in the un-stored data can be lost. Currently, linear interpolation is a popular method used to approximate data between the stored time steps. For pathline computation, however, errors from the interpolated velocity in the time dimension can accumulate quickly and make the trajectories rather unreliable. To inform the scientist the error involved in the visualization, it is important to quantify and display the uncertainty, and more importantly, to reduce the error whenever possible. In this paper, we present an algorithm to model temporal interpolation error, and an error reduction scheme to improve the data accuracy for temporally down-sampled data. We show that it is possible to compute polynomial regression and measure the interpolation errors incrementally with one sequential scan of the time-varying flow field. We also show empirically that when the data sequence is fitted with least-squares regression, the errors can be approximated with a Gaussian distribution. With the end positions of particle traces stored, we show that our error modeling scheme can better estimate the intermediate particle trajectories between the stored time steps based on a maximum likelihood method that utilizes forward and backward particle traces.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,An uncertainty-driven approach to vortex analysis using oracle consensus and spatial proximity,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Although vortex analysis and detection have been extensively investigated in the past, none of the existing techniques are able to provide fully robust and reliable identification results. Local vortex detection methods are popular as they are efficient and easy to implement, and produce binary outputs based on a user-specified, hard threshold. However, vortices are global features, which present challenges for local detectors. On the other hand, global detectors are computationally intensive and require considerable user input. In this work, we propose a consensus-based uncertainty model and introduce spatial proximity to enhance vortex detection results obtained using point-based methods. We use four existing local vortex detectors and convert their outputs into fuzzy possibility values using a sigmoid-based soft-thresholding approach. We apply a majority voting scheme that enables us to identify candidate vortex regions with a higher degree of confidence. Then, we introduce spatial proximity- based analysis to discern the final vortical regions. Thus, by using spatial proximity coupled with fuzzy inputs, we propose a novel uncertainty analysis approach for vortex detection. We use expert's input to better estimate the system parameters and results from two real-world data sets demonstrate the efficacy of our method.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Efficient volume illumination with multiple light sources through selective light updates,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Incorporating volumetric illumination into rendering of volumetric data increases visual realism, which can lead to improved spatial comprehension. It is known that spatial comprehension can be further improved by incorporating multiple light sources. However, many volumetric illumination algorithms have severe drawbacks when dealing with multiple light sources. These drawbacks are mainly high performance penalties and memory usage, which can be tackled with specialized data structures or data under sampling. In contrast, in this paper we present a method which enables volumetric illumination with multiple light sources without requiring precomputation or impacting visual quality. To achieve this goal, we introduce selective light updates which minimize the required computations when light settings are changed. We will discuss and analyze the novel concepts underlying selective light updates, and demonstrate them when applied to real-world data under different light settings.",I.3.7 [Computer Graphics]: Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realismâ€”Color;shading;shadowing;texture
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Advanced lighting for unstructured-grid data visualization,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"The benefits of using advanced illumination models in volume visualization have been demonstrated by many researchers. Interactive volume rendering incorporated with advanced lighting has been achieved with GPU acceleration for regular-grid volume data, making volume visualization even more appealing as a tool for 3D data exploration. This paper presents an interactive illumination strategy, which is specially designed and optimized for volume visualization of unstructured-grid data. The basis of the design is a partial differential equation based illumination model to simulate the light propagation, absorption, and scattering within the volumetric medium. In particular, a two-level scheme is introduced to overcome the challenges presented by unstructured grids. Test results show that the added illumination effects such as global shadowing and multiple scattering not only lead to more visually pleasing visualization, but also greatly enhance the perception of the depth information and complex spatial relationships for features of interest in the volume data. This volume visualization enhancement is introduced at a time when unstructured grids are becoming increasingly popular for a variety of scientific simulation applications.",I.3.7 [Computer Graphics]: Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realismâ€”Color;shading;shadowing;texture;I.3.8 [Computer Graphics]: Applications
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Illustrative Timelapse: A technique for illustrative visualization of particle-based simulations,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Animated movies are a popular way to communicate complex phenomena in cell biology to the broad audience. Animation artists apply sophisticated illustration techniques to communicate a story, while trying to maintain a realistic representation of a complex dynamic environment. Since such hand-crafted animations are time-consuming and cost-intensive to create, our goal is to formalize illustration techniques used by artists to facilitate the automatic creation of visualizations generated from mesoscale particle-based molecular simulations. Our technique Illustrative Timelapse supports visual exploration of complex biochemical processes in dynamic environments by (1) seamless temporal zooming to observe phenomena in different temporal resolutions, (2) visual abstraction of molecular trajectories to ensure that observers are able to visually follow the main actors, (3) increased visual focus on events of interest, and (4) lens effects to preserve a realistic representation of the environment in the context. Results from a first user study indicate that visual abstraction of trajectories improves the ability to follow a story and is also appreciated by users.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Coverage-based opacity estimation for interactive Depth of Field in molecular visualization,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In this paper, we introduce coverage-based opacity estimation to achieve Depth of Field (DoF) effects when visualizing molecular dynamics (MD) data. The proposed algorithm is a novel object-based approach which eliminates many of the shortcomings of state-of-the-art image-based DoF algorithms. Based on observations derived from a physically-correct reference renderer, coverage-based opacity estimation exploits semi-transparency to simulate the blur inherent to DoF effects. It achieves high quality DoF effects, by augmenting each atom with a semi-transparent shell, which has a radius proportional to the distance from the focal plane of the camera. Thus, each shell represents an additional coverage area whose opacity varies radially, based on our observations derived from the results of multi-sampling DoF algorithms. By using the proposed technique, it becomes possible to generate high quality visual results, comparable to those achieved through ground-truth multi-sampling algorithms. At the same time, we obtain a significant speedup which is essential for visualizing MD data as it enables interactive rendering. In this paper, we derive the underlying theory, introduce coverage-based opacity estimation and demonstrate how it can be applied to real world MD data in order to achieve DoF effects. We further analyze the achieved results with respect to performance as well as quality and show that they are comparable to images generated with modern distributed ray tracing engines.",I.3.7 [Computer Graphics]: Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realismâ€”Color;shading;shadowing;texture

It supports intuitive and interactive visual exploration and analysis of the scalar function. This paper describes a fast, parallel, and memory efficient algorithm for constructing the contour tree of a scalar function on shared memory systems. Comparisons with existing implementations show significant improvement in both the running time and the memory expended. The proposed algorithm is particularly suited for large datasets that do not fit in memory. For example, the contour tree for a scalar function defined on a 8.6 billion vertex domain (2048Ã—2048Ã—2048 volume data) can be efficiently constructed using less than 10GB of memory.",I.3.5 [Computer Graphics]: Computational Geometry and Object Modeling
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Ray tracing within a data parallel framework,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Current architectural trends on supercomputers have dramatic increases in the number of cores and available computational power per die, but this power is increasingly difficult for programmers to harness effectively. High-level language constructs can simplify programming many-core devices, but this ease comes with a potential loss of processing power, particularly for cross-platform constructs. Recently, scientific visualization packages have embraced language constructs centering around data parallelism, with familiar operators such as map, reduce, gather, and scatter. Complete adoption of data parallelism will require that central visualization algorithms be revisited, and expressed in this new paradigm while preserving both functionality and performance. This investment has a large potential payoff: portable performance in software bases that can span over the many architectures that scientific visualization applications run on. With this work, we present a method for ray tracing consisting of entirely of data parallel primitives. Given the extreme computational power on nodes now prevalent on supercomputers, we believe that ray tracing can supplant rasterization as the work-horse graphics solution for scientific visualization. Our ray tracing method is relatively efficient, and we describe its performance with a series of tests, and also compare to leading-edge ray tracers that are optimized for specific platforms. We find that our data parallel approach leads to results that are acceptable for many scientific visualization use cases, with the key benefit of providing a single code base that can run on many architectures.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Biclustering multivariate data for correlated subspace mining,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Exploring feature subspaces is one of promising approaches to analyzing and understanding the important patterns in multivariate data. If relying too much on effective enhancements in manual interventions, the associated results depend heavily on the knowledge and skills of users performing the data analysis. This paper presents a novel approach to extracting feature subspaces from multivariate data by incorporating biclustering techniques. The approach has been maximally automated in the sense that highly-correlated dimensions are automatically grouped to form subspaces, which effectively supports further exploration of them. A key idea behind our approach lies in a new mathematical formulation of asymmetric biclustering, by combining spherical k-means clustering for grouping highly-correlated dimensions, together with ordinary k-means clustering for identifying subsets of data samples. Lower-dimensional representations of data in feature subspaces are successfully visualized by parallel coordinate plot, where we project the data samples of correlated dimensions to one composite axis through dimensionality reduction schemes. Several experimental results of our data analysis together with discussions will be provided to assess the capability of our approach.",Multivariate data;subspaces;biclustering;correlation
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,Improving the fidelity of contextual data layouts using a Generalized Barycentric Coordinates framework,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Contextual layouts preserve the context of the data with the associated attributes (variables). However, their linear mapping causes errors in the layout - similar data points and variable nodes may not map to similar regions, and vice versa. In this paper, we first unify the various data layout schemes and choose the Generalized Bary-centric Coordinates (GBC) plot as the standard way to describe them. Second, we propose three algorithms - distance spaced lay-out, iterative error reduction, and force directed adjustment - to reduce the layout error of variables to variables, data to variables and data to data, respectively. We find that the combination of these three algorithms can yield large improvements in the layout error and so achieve a more comprehensive layout. Third, we describe an interface, the GBC Error Explorer, which allows users to explore the error using a variety of visualization schemes combined with some interactions.",Visual analytics;generalized barycentric coordinates;multivariate data;contextual layout

Proposed is a high-dimensional rotation technique called AGI3D, combined with an ability to filter elements based on social centrality values. AGI3D is targeted for a high-dimensional embedding of a social graph and its projection onto 3D space. It allows the user to rotate the social graph layout in the high-dimensional space by mouse dragging of a vertex. Its high-dimensional rotation effects give the user an illusion that he/she is destructively reshaping the social graph layout but in reality, it assists the user to find a preferred positioning and direction in the high-dimensional space to look at the internal structure of the social graph layout, keeping it unmodified.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,TrajRank: Exploring travel behaviour on a route by trajectory ranking,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In this paper, we propose a novel visual analysis method TrajRank to study the travel behaviour of vehicles along one route. We focus on the spatial-temporal distribution of travel time, i.e., the time spent on each road segment and the travel time variation in rush/non-rush hours. TrajRank first allows users to interactively select a route, and segment it into several road segments. Then trajectories passing this route are automatically extracted. These trajectories are ranked on each road segment according to travel time and further clustered according to the rankings on all road segments. Based on the above ranking analysis, we provide a temporal distribution view showing the temporal distribution of travel time and a ranking diagram view showing the spatial variation of travel time. With real taxi GPS data, we present three use cases and an informal user study to show the effectiveness and usability of our method.",travel behaviour;ranking visualization;filtering

IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Exploring Curved Schematization,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Hand-drawn schematized maps traditionally make extensive use of curves. However, there are few automated approaches for curved schematization most previous work focuses on straight lines. We present a new algorithm for area-preserving curved schematization of geographic outlines. Our algorithm converts a simple polygon into a schematic crossing-free representation using circular arcs. We use two basic operations to iteratively replace consecutive arcs until the desired complexity is reached. Our results are not restricted to arcs ending at input vertices. The method can be steered towards different degrees of 'curviness': we can encourage or discourage the use of arcs with a large central angle via a single parameter. Our method creates visually pleasing results even for very low output complexities. We conducted an online user study investigating the effectiveness of the curved schematizations compared to straight-line schematizations of equivalent complexity. While the visual complexity of the curved shapes was judged higher than those using straight lines, users generally preferred curved schematizations. We observed that curves significantly improved the ability of users to match schematized shapes of moderate complexity to their unschematized equivalents.",Geographic Information Systems;Computational Geometry and Object Modeling
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,FlowString: Partial Streamline Matching Using Shape Invariant Similarity Measure for Exploratory Flow Visualization,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Measuring the similarity of integral curves is fundamental to many important flow data analysis and visualization tasks such as feature detection, pattern querying, streamline clustering and hierarchical exploration. In this paper, we introduce FlowString, a novel approach that extracts shape invariant features from streamlines and utilizes a string-based method for exploratory streamline analysis and visualization. Our solution first resamples streamlines by considering their local feature scales. We then classify resampled points along streamlines based on the shape similarity around their local neighborhoods. We encode each streamline into a string of well-selected shape characters, from which we construct meaningful words for querying and retrieval. A unique feature of our approach is that it captures intrinsic streamline similarity that is invariant under translation, rotation and scaling. Leveraging the suffix tree, we enable efficient search of streamline patterns with arbitrary lengths with the complexity linear to the size of the respective pattern. We design an intuitive interface and user interactions to support flexible querying, allowing exact and approximate searches for robust partial streamline similarity matching. Users can perform queries at either the character level or the word level, and define their own characters or words conveniently for customized search. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FlowString with several flow field data sets of different sizes and characteristics.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Non-overlapping Aggregated Multivariate Glyphs for Moving Objects,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In moving object visualization, objects and their attributes are commonly represented by glyphs on a geographic map. In areas on the map densely populated by these objects, visual clutter and occlusion of glyphs occur. We propose a method to solve this problem by partitioning the set of all objects into subsets that are each visualized using an aggregated multivariate glyph that shows the distribution of several attributes of its objects, such as heading, type and velocity. We choose the combination of subsets and glyph design such that the glyphs do not overlap and the number of subsets is approximately maximal. The partition is maintained and updated while the objects move. We use examples from the maritime domain, but our method is applicable to a wider range of dynamic data. Through a user study we find that, for a set of representative tasks, our method does not perform significantly worse than competitive visualizations with respect to correctness. Furthermore, it performs significantly better for density comparison tasks in high density data sets. We also find that the participants of the user study have a preference for our method.",Glyph-based Techniques (primary keyword);Scalability Issues;Computer GraphicsPicture/Image Generation
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,FlowTour: An Automatic Guide for Exploring Internal Flow Features,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"We present FlowTour, a novel framework that provides an automatic guide for exploring internal flow features. Our algorithm first identifies critical regions and extracts their skeletons for feature characterization and streamline placement. We then create candidate viewpoints based on the construction of a simplified mesh enclosing each critical region and select best viewpoints based on a viewpoint quality measure. Finally, we design a tour that traverses all selected viewpoints in a smooth and efficient manner for visual navigation and exploration of the flow field. Unlike most existing works which only consider external viewpoints, a unique contribution of our work is that we also incorporate internal viewpoints to enable a clear observation of what lies inside of the flow field. Our algorithm is thus particularly useful for exploring hidden or occluded flow features in a large and complex flow field. We demonstrate our algorithm with several flow data sets and perform a user study to confirm the effectiveness of our approach.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Scalable Lagrangian-Based Attribute Space Projection for Multivariate Unsteady Flow Data,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In this paper, we present a novel scalable approach for visualizing multivariate unsteady flow data with Lagrangian-based Attribute Space Projection (LASP). The distances between spatial temporal samples are evaluated by their attribute values along the advection directions in the flow field. The massive samples are then projected into 2D screen space for feature identification and selection. A hybrid parallel system, which tightly integrates a MapReduce-style particle tracer with a scalable algorithm for massive projection, is designed to support the large scale analysis. Results show that the proposed methods and system are capable of visualizing features in the unsteady flow, which couples multivariate analysis of vector and scalar attributes with projection.",Flow visualization;attribute space projection;parallel processing
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Moment Invariants for 2D Flow Fields Using Normalization,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"The analysis of 2D flow data is often guided by the search for characteristic structures with semantic meaning. One way to approach this question is to identify structures of interest by a human observer. The challenge then, is to find similar structures in the same or other datasets on different scales and orientations. In this paper, we propose to use moment invariants as pattern descriptors for flow fields. Moment invariants are one of the most popular techniques for the description of objects in the field of image recognition. They have recently also been applied to identify 2D vector patterns limited to the directional properties of flow fields. In contrast to previous work, we follow the intuitive approach of moment normalization, which results in a complete and independent set of translation, rotation, and scaling invariant flow field descriptors. They also allow to distinguish flow features with different velocity profiles. We apply the moment invariants in a pattern recognition algorithm to a real world dataset and show that the theoretic results can be extended to discrete functions in a robust way.",Moment invariants;flow fields;normalization;Feature MeasurementMoments;Design MethodologyClassifier design and evaluation
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,2D Vector Field Simplification Based on Robustness,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Vector field simplification aims to reduce the complexity of the flow by removing features in order of their relevance and importance, to reveal prominent behavior and obtain a compact representation for interpretation. Most existing simplification techniques based on the topological skeleton successively remove pairs of critical points connected by separatrices, using distance or area-based relevance measures. These methods rely on the stable extraction of the topological skeleton, which can be difficult due to instability in numerical integration, especially when processing highly rotational flows. These geometric metrics do not consider the flow magnitude, an important physical property of the flow. In this paper, we propose a novel simplification scheme derived from the recently introduced topological notion of robustness, which provides a complementary view on flow structure compared to the traditional topological-skeleton-based approaches. Robustness enables the pruning of sets of critical points according to a quantitative measure of their stability, that is, the minimum amount of vector field perturbation required to remove them. This leads to a hierarchical simplification scheme that encodes flow magnitude in its perturbation metric. Our novel simplification algorithm is based on degree theory, has fewer boundary restrictions, and so can handle more general cases. Finally, we provide an implementation under the piecewise-linear setting and apply it to both synthetic and real-world datasets.",Vector field data;topology-based techniques;flow visualization

We present an edge-bundling method using density-based clustering for each dimension. This reduces clutter and provides a faster overview of clusters and trends. Moreover, it allows rendering the clustered lines using polygons, decreasing rendering time remarkably. In addition, we design interactions to support multidimensional clustering with this method.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Visual Signature of High-Dimensional Geometry in Parallel Coordinates,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Although we can interactively rotate a 3D projected high-dimensional geometry and observe its dynamic changes, this traditional visualization method is limited and highly sensitive to the choice of viewing direction. Parallel-coordinates plots supplement this visualization scenario by providing statistical analysis of the geometry for distinct pairs of co-dimensions. Such analysis results in visual signatures that embed geometric structures such as symmetry, and thus allows us to overview the status of the missing dimensions while exploring the projected geometry. This paper presents a blue-noise sampling approach for efficient construction of continuous parallel-coordinates plots of high-dimensional geometric surfaces defined by mathematical equations. We employ the parallel-coordinates plots with the embedded visual signatures to assist the interactive exploration of high-dimensional geometries, typically for 2-manifold embedded in 4-space. While we interactively explore the 3D projected geometry, we can observe dynamic changes on its visual signature. Various geometric properties can also be identified and visualized. Moreover, we can interactively brush the plots, and see their counterparts in the 3D projection. Assorted geometric properties such as curvature can further be used to enhance the visual signature.",Parallel coordinates;geometry-based Techniques;coordinated and multiple views;visualization in mathematics;Computer GraphicsApplications;Mathematical Software
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,ScagExplorer: Exploring Scatterplots by Their Scagnostics,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"A scatter plot displays a relation between a pair of variables. Given a set of v variables, there are v(v- 1)/2 pairs of variables, and thus the same number of possible pair wise scatter plots. Therefore for even small sets of variables, the number of scatter plots can be large. Scatter plot matrices (SPLOMs) can easily run out of pixels when presenting high-dimensional data. We introduce a theoretical method and a testbed for assessing whether our method can be used to guide interactive exploration of high-dimensional data. The method is based on nine characterizations of the 2D distributions of orthogonal pair wise projections on a set of points in multidimensional Euclidean space. Working directly with these characterizations, we can locate anomalies for further analysis or search for similar distributions in a large SPLOM with more than a hundred dimensions.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Hierarchical Focus+Context Heterogeneous Network Visualization,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Aggregation is a scalable strategy for dealing with large network data.

OnionGraph allows nodes to be aggregated based on either node attributes, topology, or a mixture of both. Subsets of nodes can be flexibly split and merged under the hierarchical focus+context interaction model, supporting sophisticated analysis of the network data. Node aggregations that contain subsets of nodes are displayed with multiple concentric circles, or the onion metaphor, indicating how many levels of abstraction they contain.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Rebuilding KEGG Maps: Algorithms and Benefits,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Static drawings of biological pathways are still an important research tool for biologists. Gerhard Michal created his seminal drawings of metabolic networks in the 1960s and thus defined canonical representations of some key pathways. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) provides the most popular static drawings of biological networks of different types, used in a huge number of publications. These drawings are so widely known that they are immediately recognizable to most biologists. This enables collaborative work and simplifies the communication of analysis results. Automatic layout of these pathway maps is complicated by the fact that the information available from KEGG does not contain the entire layout information of the reference maps. Here we present a fully automated algorithm for interactive KEGG layout construction. The algorithm conserves the original KEGG layout to the extent possible while improving readability by removing unnecessary elements (in organism-specific maps). Multiple pathway maps can be laid out simultaneously to facilitate the navigation of larger networks.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Improved Optimal and Approximate Power Graph Compression for Clearer Visualisation of Dense Graphs,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Drawings of highly connected (dense) graphs can be very difficult to read. Power Graph Analysis offers an alternate way to draw a graph in which sets of nodes with common neighbours are shown grouped into modules. An edge connected to the module then implies a connection to each member of the module. Thus, the entire graph may be represented with much less clutter and without loss of detail. A recent experimental study has shown that such lossless compression of dense graphs makes it easier to follow paths. However, computing optimal power graphs is difficult. In this paper, we show that computing the optimal power-graph with only one module is NP-hard and therefore likely NP-hard in the general case. We give an ILP model for power graph computation and discuss why ILP and CP techniques are poorly suited to the problem. Instead, we are able to find optimal solutions much more quickly using a custom search method. We also show how to restrict this type of search to allow only limited back-tracking to provide a heuristic that has better speed and better results than previously known heuristics.",Graph Visualisation;Graph Compression;Optimization
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Maps of Computer Science,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"We describe a practical approach for visual exploration of research papers. Specifically, we use the titles of papers from the DBLP database to create what we call maps of computer science (MoCS).

With the help of heatmaps, we can visualize the profile of a particular conference or journal over the base map. Similarly, heatmap profiles can be made of individual researchers or groups such as a department. The visualization system also makes it possible to change the data used to generate the base map. For example, a specific journal or conference can be used to generate the base map and then the heatmap overlays can be used to show the evolution of research topics in the field over the years. As before, individual researchers or research group profiles can be visualized using heatmap overlays over a specific journal or conference base map.

In contrast to previous approaches that provide users with an animated visualization, GraphFlow offers a static flow visualization that summarizes the graph metrics of the entire graph and its evolution over time. Our solution supports the discovery of high-level patterns that are difficult to identify in an animation or in individual static representations. In addition, GraphFlow provides users with a set of interactions to create filtered views. These views allow users to investigate why a particular pattern has occurred.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Visualizing Hidden Themes of Taxi Movement with Semantic Transformation,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"A new methodology is developed to discover and analyze the hidden knowledge of massive taxi trajectory data within a city. This approach creatively transforms the geographic coordinates (i.e. latitude and longitude) to street names reflecting contextual semantic information. Consequently, the movement of each taxi is studied as a document consisting of the taxi traversed street names, which enables semantic analysis of massive taxi data sets as document corpora. Hidden themes, namely taxi topics, are identified through textual topic modeling techniques. The taxi topics reflect urban mobility patterns and trends, which are displayed and analyzed through a visual analytics system. The system integrates interactive visualization tools, including taxi topic maps, topic routes, street clouds and parallel coordinates, to visualize the probability-based topical information. Urban planners, administration, travelers, and drivers can conduct their various knowledge discovery tasks with direct semantic and visual assists.

It showcases how interdisciplinary work can lead to new insight and progress in both fields. Our case is concerned with one step in the product development process. Its goal is the design of mechanical parts that are functional, meet required quality measures and can be manufactured with standard production methods.

During the course of the collaboration many concrete questions arose and in the end a hypothesis was developed which will be discussed and evaluated in this paper. We facilitate a case study to validate our hypothesis. For the case study we consider the design of a reinforcement structure of a brake lever, a plastic ribbing. Three new lever geometries are developed on basis of our hypothesis and are compared against each other and against a reference model. The validation comprises standard numerical and experimental tests. In our case, all new structures outperform the reference geometry. The results are very promising and suggest potential to impact the product development process also for more complex scenarios.",Tensor visualization;visualization in mechanical engineering
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,FiberScout: An Interactive Tool for Exploring and Analyzing Fiber Reinforced Polymers,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Advanced composites such as fiber reinforced polymers are promising candidate materials for future components as they allow integrating the continuously rising demands of industry regarding cost-effectiveness, function-orientation, integration and weight. The most important structures of fiber reinforced polymers are the individual fibers, as their characteristics (stiffness, strength, ductility, durability, etc.) to a large extent determine the properties of the final component. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new system for interactive exploration and visual analysis of fiber properties in X-ray computed tomography data of fiber reinforced polymers. The presented tool uses parallel coordinates to define and configure initial fiber classes. Using a scatter plot matrix linked to the parallel coordinates the initial classification may be refined. This allows to analyze hidden relationships between individual fiber properties. 2D and 3D views depict the resulting fiber classifications. By using polar plots an intuitive rendering of the fiber orientation distribution is provided. In addition, two modules of higher abstraction are proposed: The Blob visualization creates a hull around fibers with similar characteristics. The fiber metadata visualization allows to calculate overlays for 2D and 3D views containing regional information of particular material characteristics. The proposed system has been evaluated by two groups of domain experts. Applying the presented concepts the user feedback shows that the domain experts are now able to efficiently perform tasks as classification of fibers, visualization of fiber lengths and orientations, and visualization of fiber regions. The insights gained can be forwarded to the design office as well as to material development and simulation, in order to speed up the development of novel composite components.",Methodology and TechniquesInteraction techniques

IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Revisiting Crisis Maps with Geo-temporal Tag Visualization,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Crowd sourced crisis mapping is a relatively new phenomenon and platform that enables the collection and visualization of real-time crisis data submitted by users through social media tools and cellular technologies. Crisis maps are generally used by both state and non-state actors for sense-making and as a reference point for action. The current crisis map visualizations only show the location from which documents such as reports or short messages have been generated. Such a limited representation fails to immediately show important content, such as themes from a document and their changes over time. As a result, sense-making becomes time-consuming and cognitively demanding. We present a new visualization approach, Geo-Temporal Tag Visualization (GTViz), which treats the tags on the crowd sourced reports as spatio-temporal textual datasets. GTViz embeds a map to represent the spatial properties of the dataset and compactly shows the changes of key terms from the data source over time. We demonstrate the value of GTViz through two case studies and a controlled user study.",Crisis mapping;tag clouds;textual data;spatio-temporal visualization

A map is often used to show the spatial context while various temporal displays like time series plots can be used to present the changes in the data over time. In this paper, we present a novel visualization that can seamlessly embed temporal displays into a map for occlusion-free visualization of both the spatial and temporal attributes of the data. We first extend the seam carving algorithm to broaden the roads of interest in a map with the least distortion to other areas, and then embed temporal displays into the roads to reveal temporal patterns without the occlusion of map information. We study various design choices in our method, including the encoding of the time direction and temporal display, and conduct two comprehensive user studies to validate our design decisions. We also demonstrate the usability of our approach with case studies on real traffic flow data in a major city.",spatio-temporal visualization;time direction;seam carving;traffic flow;Spatio-temporal visualizationSeam carving

Thus not only more movements of people are tracked but also POI (point of interest) information becomes available in increasing geo-spatial density. To enable analysis of movement behavior, we present an approach to enrich trajectory data with semantic POI information and show how additional insights can be gained. Using a density-based clustering technique we extract 1.215 frequent destinations of ~150.000 user movements from a large e-mobility database. We query available context information from Foursquare, a popular location-based social network, to enrich the destinations with semantic background. As GPS measurements can be noisy, often more then one possible destination is found and movement patterns vary over time. Therefore we present highly interactive visualizations that enable an analyst to cope with the inherent geospatial and behavioral uncertainties.",Visual Analytics;Visual Movement Analysis;Context Enrichment;Sensemaking;Social Media;Movement Behaviour;Information Storage and Retrieval;Information Search and RetrievalInformation filtering;Query formulation;Selection process;Database Applica
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Efficient Range Distribution Query for Visualizing Scientific Data,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Visualization applications implicitly run queries on the data to retrieve distributions and statistical measures derivable from distributions. Distribution based data summaries can substitute for the raw data to answer statistical queries of different kinds. However, frequent access to the raw data is no longer practical, if possible at all, for answering large number of queries on large-scale data. Our work addresses the issue by accelerating range distribution query, which returns the distribution of an axis-aligned query region. Maintaining the interactivity of such query is a challenging task because the workload and the response time of such queries scale up with the data and the query size. In this paper, we present a framework for answering range distribution queries for any arbitrary region in near constant time, regardless of data and query size. We adapt an integral histogram based data structure to bound the workload which is a combination of computation, I/O and communication cost. We propose two novel transformations of this data structure -- a decomposition and a similarity-driven indexing -- to reduce the huge storage cost associated with it. In addition to studying the performance of range distribution query, we also demonstrate the benefits that our technique offers to visualization applications which directly or indirectly require distributions.",Distributions;Indexing;Query;Large data
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Multidimensional Projection with Radial Basis Function and Control Points Selection,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Multidimensional projection techniques provide an appealing approach for multivariate data analysis, for their ability to translate high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional representation that preserves neighborhood information. In recent years, pushed by the ever increasing data complexity in many areas, numerous advances in such techniques have been observed, primarily in terms of computational efficiency and support for interactive applications. Both these achievements were made possible due to the introduction of the concept of control points, which are used in many different multidimensional projection techniques. However, little attention has been drawn towards the process of control points selection. In this work we propose a novel multidimensional projection technique based on radial basis functions (RBF). Our method uses RBF to create a function that maps the data into a low-dimensional space by interpolating the previously calculated position of control points. We also present a built-in method for the control points selection based on ""forward-selection"" and ""Orthogonal Least Squares"" techniques. We demonstrate that the proposed selection process allows our technique to work with only a few control points while retaining the projection quality and avoiding redundant control points.",High-Dimensional Data;Dimensionality Reduction;Multidimensional Projection;Interpolation with Radial Basis Functions
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Manipulating Bilevel Feature Space for Category-Aware Image Exploration,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"The demand for interactively designing the image feature space has been increasing due to the ongoing need for image retrieval, recognition, and labeling. Although conventional methods provide an interface for locally rearranging such a feature space, category-level global manipulation is still missing and thus manually rearranging the overall image categorization usually requires a time-consuming task. This paper presents a novel approach to exploring images in the database through the manipulation of bi-level feature space representations, where the upper-and lower-level representations characterize the global categories and local features of the images, respectively. In this approach, the upper-level space describes similarity relationship among the underlying categories extracted from the bag-of-features model, while the lower-level space encodes the closeness between a pair of images within the same category. The key idea behind this approach is to associate the relationship between the two feature spaces with a two-layered graph representation and project it onto 2D screen space using pivot MDS for user manipulation. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate that our approach allows users to understand the entire structure of the given image dataset and reorganize the layout according to their preference both locally and globally.",Image exploration;feature space manipulation;bag-of-features;dimensionality reduction;Methodology and Techniques;Multimedia Information Systems

Our techniques allow animation between view configurations, semantic filtering and view deformation. Any data subset can be selected at any step along the animation. Data can be filtered and deformed to reduce occlusion and ease complex data selections.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,A New Type of Web Graph for Personalized Visualization,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Over the past few years, research on web information visualization is focusing on how to present the web information to end users effectively and efficiently. Nevertheless, with increasing size of the information in the web-space, it has become very difficult to visualize information and the inherent relationships among the information. Because of web graphs being messy and large, end users need to allow extra effort to mine interested information from those. Existing web graphs produce relationships among nodes (URLs) based on structural linkage information. As a result, by producing similar visualization to different end users, this approach lacks effectiveness considering diversity of users' need. In our work, we encounter this issue of personalization in visualization of web graph. We propose a different web graph which capitalizes on user interests to develop relationships among nodes of the web graph.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Bridging the Gap of Network Management and Anomaly Detection through Interactive Visualization,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Large-scale networks have become increasingly challenging to manage. It is vital for a system administrator or network manager to be able to analyze the vast amount of log data in order to detect suspicious behaviors or patterns, possibly due to malicious users/applications or faulty devices. While an intrusion detection system (IDS) log can provide a large number of warnings, exactly which alarms are true while the others are false, and more importantly what are the underlying causes are still difficult to know. To bridge the gap between network log and anomaly discovery, we design and implement a visualization tool that combines multiple commodity visualizations with minimum learning curve. While each individual view is well understood, the effects of such views in analyzing network anomalies are not well studied. Since each visualization technique has advantages as well as limitations in addressing a particular task, we show that these views, when combined and linked together, may provide an effective and lightweight network anomaly analysis tool. The web-based open platform may simplify network administration as well as promote collaborative analysis among researchers.",Network Anomaly Visualization

IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,A Stochastic Approach for Rendering Multiple Irregular Volumes,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In this paper, we propose a technique for rendering multiple irregular volumes using a stochastic approach. In this approach, we extend our stochastic projected tetrahedral (SPT) algorithm to treat irregular volumes. The SPT algorithm is a sorting-free volume rendering algorithm that projects a tetrahedral cell onto an image plane and controls the particle rendering using the opacity as the probability in the rasterization process. In the rasterization process, the particle depth is determined as that of a pre-defined location, which may be the front, back or middle point on a ray segment in the SPT algorithm. This determination causes a prominent artifact when treating multiple volumes, although it does not cause any problem when treating a single volume. The artifact occurs because the SPT algorithm controls the particle stochastically in the image plane but not in the depth direction. In the volume rendering process, it is assumed that the number of particles follows a Poisson distribution along the segment of the viewing ray that intersects the tetrahedral cell. The particle spacing follows the exponential distribution. In this case, we construct a cumulative distribution function of the particle spacing and develop a technique for calculating the nearest particle along the interval. We apply this technique to multiple volumes to confirm its effectiveness.",volume rendering;semi-transparency;irregular volume;multiple volumes;Picture/Image Generation display algorithm;Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism color;shading;shadowing;and texture

IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,2-3-4 Combination for Parallel Compression on the K Computer,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"The development of supercomputers has successfully helped us to carry on complicated simulation with exploded size of dataset. For visualizing such kind of large-scale dataset, reducing the data size by using compression methods is one of the most useful approach. Moreover, parallelization of compression algorithm can greatly improve the efficiency and resolve the limitation of memory size. However, in parallel compression algorithm, interprocessor communication is indispensable, while it is also a bottleneck problem, especially for the general cases that the number of processors is not power-of-two. Parallel POD (proper orthogonal decomposition) compression algorithm is such an example, the number of time steps must be power-of-two for the binary swap scheme. A method that can fully resolve this problem with low computational cost will be very popular. In this paper, we proposed such an approach called 2-3-4 combination approach, which can be simply implemented and also reach high performance of parallel computing algorithms. Furthermore, our method can obtain the best balance among all parallel computing processors. This is achieved by transferring the non-power-of-two problem into power-of-two problem to fully use the best balance feature of binary swap method.

Vortex structures, such as those used for fishing grounds exploration, are crucial for exploring fishing ground because they can drive nutrients from the ocean floor to the sea surface. The ability to locate fishing grounds therefore depends on accurate ocean forecasting systems for calculating ocean model variables such as temperature, salinity, velocity etc. Currently, these forecasts are based on multiple spatio-temporal simulations that produce multidimensional and multivariate results.

IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Analytical Visualization of Large-Scale Data of 3D Cultural Objects,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"For appreciating 3D cultural objects, e.g., artistic statues, traditional vehicles, and historical buildings or cities, visualization has mainly been used in the following styles: (1) realistic computer graphics, (2) artistic computer graphics, and (3) interactive virtual reality. However, for academic studying of 3D cultural objects, these styles are insufficient. Namely, we need more analytical styles that can extract invisible or veiled features of visualized targets. What makes such analytical visualization more important is recent rapid development of range-sensing technology to digitally archive real 3D objects. For example, modern laser scanning produces over 107 or 108 3D point data for one measurement. To extract useful information from such large-scale and complex data, we need (A) precise 3D transparent visualization, (B) superposition of visual assistants, and (C) time-series visualization.",Computer Graphics;Miscellaneous Image Processing and Computer Vision;Scene AnalysisRange data
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Agenda Setting in Policy-Making Using Visualization Techniques,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In this talk, we will clarify roles of visualization techniques which are mandatory to employ a scientific method in policy-making. Currently, many countries are investing heavily in policy-making process development through the ICT for this purpose. In the policy cycle, there are many opportunities in which a scientific method can be effectively applied especially in the agenda setting. In the phase, it is important to visualize a cognitive structure in a citizen. We focus on the evaluation grid method to figure out the citizen's requirement. Once we construct the cognitive structure represented by a graph in which nodes and arcs are represented as constructs and relationships between them, respectively, we can develop a predictive cognitive model which will be useful in the agenda setting. For this purpose we employ multivariate visualization techniques which can figure out meaningful relationships in the cognitive model.",Policy-making;Evaluation grid method;Multivariate visualization

We often discover interesting behavior from such visualization results, and feel several results demonstrate Japanese specific behavior and mentality. This talk introduces some of our visual analytics results which denote such Japanese specific behavior and mentality. Due to the space limitation, this manuscript just introduces two of the examples, though the talk may introduce more examples.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2014,Visualizing Differences of DTI Fiber Models Using 2D Normalized Embeddings,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Illustrating the differences between DTI fiber models is important for the purposes of group comparison, atlas construction, and uncertainty analysis. Standard approaches show difference between DTI models in 3D space, with either voxel-based or fiber based comparison. We proposes a new method that embeds a high-dimensional 3D fiber model as a continuous map in a 2D normalized space, built on fibers from all targeted fiber models. One advantage over previous 2D embedding approaches is that our method represents all fiber models in a unified coordinate system by taking a cluster-and-project routine, ensuring that closely located fibers from different models will be projected to close points on the 2D map. Using this projected 2D map, subtle differences that are difficult to distinguish in 3D space can be clearly displayed and individual fiber model can be effectively summarized. We applied our method to group comparison and analysis of various fiber models.",Difference Visualization;Diffusion Tensor Imaging;Tractography;Uncertainty;Life and Medical SciencesLife Cycle

IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Keynote speaker: Graph animation,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In several applications there is the need of visualizing a graph whose structure evolves over time. A few examples: in the networking field it is often necessary to show how the flow of packets changes according to network modifications; in the Internet Domain Name System it is useful to study the evolution of the relationship between name servers sending queries and name servers answering such queries; and in Web crawling it is interesting to study, during the Web exploration, how the structure of the visited hyperlinks depends on the actual search strategy. From the point of view of the graph drawing field these animation requirements pose difficult challenges for at least three reasons. First, instead of constructing just one layout of one graph, graph animation requires to construct several layouts, depending on the duration of the animation. This poses nontrivial efficiency issues. Second, the user's mental map should be preserved. Hence, the graph layouts of consecutive steps cannot be too much different. Third, to help the user in easily perceiving the changes, morphing problems must be tackled. Namely, the same portion of the graph might be represented in two different ways in two different times of the animation. Hence, the problem arises of how to compute a smooth morphing between the two representations. I will survey experiences of graph animation at the Graph Drawing Lab of the UniversitÃ  Roma Tre both from the pragmatic and from the methodological points of view.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Keynote speaker: Big data: A scientific visualization perspective,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Summary form only given. Modern high performance computers have speeds measured in petaflops and handle data set sizes measured in terabytes and petabytes. In the next decade (or less) we will see exascale computational resources. Although these machines offer enormous potential for solving very large-scale realistic computational problems, their effectiveness will hinge upon the ability of human experts to interact with their simulation results and extract useful information. One of the greatest scientific challenges of the 21st century is to effectively understand and make use of the vast amount of information being produced. Visual data analysis will be among our most important tools in helping to understand such large-scale information.",

IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Circular-arc cartograms,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"We present a new circular-arc cartogram model in which countries are drawn as polygons with circular arcs instead of straight-line segments. Given a political map and values associated with each country in the map, a cartogram is a distorted map in which the areas of the countries are proportional to the corresponding values. In the circular-arc cartogram model straight-line segments can be replaced by circular arcs in order to modify the areas of the polygons, while the corners of the polygons remain fixed. The countries in circular-arc cartograms have the aesthetically pleasing appearance of clouds or snowflakes, depending on whether their edges are bent outwards or inwards. This makes it easy to determine whether a country has grown or shrunk, just by its overall shape. We show that determining whether a given map and given area-values can be realized as a circular-arc cartogram is an NP-hard problem. Next we describe a heuristic method for constructing circular-arc cartograms, which uses a max-flow computation on the dual graph of the map, along with a computation of the straight skeleton of the underlying polygonal decomposition. Our method is implemented and produces cartograms that, while not yet perfectly accurate, achieve many of the desired areas in our real-world examples.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Exploring entities in text with descriptive non-photorealistic rendering,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"We present a novel approach to text visualization called descriptive non-photorealistic rendering which exploits the inherent spatial and abstract dimensions in text documents to integrate 3D non-photorealistic rendering with information visualization. The visualization encodes text data onto 3D models, emphasizing the relative significance of words in the text and the physical, real-world relationships between those words. Analytic exploration is supported through a collection of interactive widgets and direct multitouch interaction with the 3D models. We applied our method to analyze a collection of vehicle complaint reports from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and through a qualitative study, we demonstrate how our system can support tasks such as comparing the reliability of different models, finding interesting facts, and revealing possible causal relations between car parts.",Integrating Spatial and Non-Spatial Data;Text Visualization;Non-photorealistic Rendering
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Constrained optimization for disoccluding geographic landmarks in 3D urban maps,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In composing hand-drawn 3D urban maps, the most common design problem is to avoid overlaps between geographic features such as roads and buildings by displacing them consistently over the map domain. Nonetheless, automating this map design process is still a challenging task because we have to maximally retain the 3D depth perception inherent in pairs of parallel lines embedded in the original layout of such geographic features. This paper presents a novel approach to disoccluding important geographic features when creating 3D urban maps for enhancing their visual readability. This is accomplished by formulating the design criteria as a constrained optimization problem based on the linear programming approach. Our mathematical formulation allows us to systematically eliminate occlusions of landmark roads and buildings, and further controls the degree of local 3D map deformation by devising an objective function to be minimized. Various design examples together with a user study are presented to demonstrate the robustness and feasibility of the proposed approach.",

In these cases the regular shapes of the grid cells allows easy representation of extra information about the regions. The main challenge is to find an association that allows a user to find a region in the grid quickly. We call the representation of a set of regions as a grid a grid map.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Reordering Massive Sequence Views: Enabling temporal and structural analysis of dynamic networks,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Networks are present in many fields such as finance, sociology, and transportation. Often these networks are dynamic: they have a structural as well as a temporal aspect. We present a technique that extends the Massive Sequence View (MSV) for the analysis of the temporal and structural aspects of dynamic networks. Using features in the data as well as in the visualization based on the Gestalt principles closure, proximity, and similarity, we developed node reordering strategies for the MSV to make these features stand out. This enables users to find temporal properties such as trends, counter trends, periodicity, temporal shifts, and anomalies in the network as well as structural properties such as communities and stars. We show the effectiveness of the reordering methods on both synthetic and real-world transaction data sets.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Smooth bundling of large streaming and sequence graphs,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Dynamic graphs are increasingly pervasive in modern information systems. However, understanding how a graph changes in time is difficult. We present here two techniques for simplified visualization of dynamic graphs using edge bundles. The first technique uses a recent image-based graph bundling method to create smoothly changing bundles from streaming graphs. The second technique incorporates additional edge-correspondence data and is thereby suited to visualize discrete graph sequences. We illustrate our methods with examples from real-world large dynamic graph datasets.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,GraphCharter: Combining browsing with query to explore large semantic graphs,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Large scale semantic graphs such as social networks and knowledge graphs contain rich and useful information. However, due to combined challenges in scale, density, and heterogeneity, it is impractical for users to answer many interesting questions by visual inspection alone. This is because even a semantically simple question, such as which of my extended friends are also fans of my favorite band, can in fact require information from a non-trivial number of nodes to answer. In this paper, we propose a method that combines graph browsing with query to overcome the limitation of visual inspection. By using query as the main way for information discovery in graph exploration, our â€œquery, expand, and query againâ€ model enables users to probe beyond the visible part of the graph and only bring in the interesting nodes, leaving the view clutter-free. We have implemented a prototype called GraphCharter and demonstrated its effectiveness and usability in a case study and a user study on Freebase knowledge graph with millions of nodes and edges.",Graph browsing;graph query;visual query;semantic graphs;heterogeneous-edged graphs;social graphs
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Visual summaries for graph collections,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Graphs can be used to represent a variety of information, from molecular structures to biological pathways to computational workflows. With a growing volume of data represented as graphs, the problem of understanding and analyzing the variations in a collection of graphs is of increasing importance. We present an algorithm to compute a single summary graph that efficiently encodes an entire collection of graphs by finding and merging similar nodes and edges. Instead of only merging nodes and edges that are exactly the same, we use domain-specific comparison functions to collapse similar nodes and edges which allows us to generate more compact representations of the collection. In addition, we have developed methods that allow users to interactively control the display of these summary graphs. These interactions include the ability to highlight individual graphs in the summary, control the succinctness of the summary, and explicitly define when specific nodes should or should not be merged. We show that our approach to generating and interacting with graph summaries leads to a better understanding of a graph collection by allowing users to more easily identify common substructures and key differences between graphs.",

Localized transfer functions are defined on scalar topology regions specified by the user. Intelligent and fast feature inference algorithms have been developed to convert user's input to the region specification and to achieve desirable feature styles with the local transfer functions. In our system, users can not only manipulate the color appearance of the object volume, but also apply style transfer and generate various illustration styles with a unified input gesture. Without manual transfer function editing and without parameter specification, our system is capable of generating informative illustrations that intuitively highlight user specified local features.",Volume visualization;Local transfer functions;WYSIWYG;Scalar field topology;Sketch-based user interface
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Transfer function design based on user selected samples for intuitive multivariate volume exploration,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Multivariate volumetric datasets are important to both science and medicine. We propose a transfer function (TF) design approach based on user selected samples in the spatial domain to make multivariate volumetric data visualization more accessible for domain users. Specifically, the user starts the visualization by probing features of interest on slices and the data values are instantly queried by user selection. The queried sample values are then used to automatically and robustly generate high dimensional transfer functions (HDTFs) via kernel density estimation (KDE). Alternatively, 2D Gaussian TFs can be automatically generated in the dimensionality reduced space using these samples. With the extracted features rendered in the volume rendering view, the user can further refine these features using segmentation brushes. Interactivity is achieved in our system and different views are tightly linked. Use cases show that our system has been successfully applied for simulation and complicated seismic data sets.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Evaluation of Depth of Field for depth perception in DVR,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In this paper we present a user study on the use of Depth of Field for depth perception in Direct Volume Rendering. Direct Volume Rendering with Phong shading and perspective projection is used as the baseline. Depth of Field is then added to see its impact on the correct perception of ordinal depth. Accuracy and response time are used as the metrics to evaluate the usefulness of Depth of Field. The onsite user study has two parts: static and dynamic. Eye tracking is used to monitor the gaze of the subjects. From our results we see that though Depth of Field does not act as a proper depth cue in all conditions, it can be used to reinforce the perception of which feature is in front of the other. The best results (high accuracy & fast response time) for correct perception of ordinal depth occurs when the front feature (out of the two features users were to choose from) is in focus and perspective projection is used.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Transformations for volumetric range distribution queries,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Volumetric datasets continue to grow in size, and there is continued demand for interactive analysis on these datasets. Because storage device throughputs are not increasing as quickly, interactive analysis workflows are becoming working set-constrained. In an ideal workflow, the working set complexity of the interactive analysis portion of the workflow should depend primarily on the size of the analysis result being produced, rather than on the size of the data being analyzed. Past works in online analytical processing and visualization have addressed this problem within application-specific contexts, but have not generalized their solutions to a wider variety of visualization applications. We propose a general framework for reducing the working set complexity of the interactive portion of visualization workflows that can be built on top of distribution range queries, as well as a technique within this framework able to support multiple visualization applications. Transformations are applied in the preprocessing phase of the workflow to enable fast, approximate volumetric distribution range queries with low working set complexity. Interactive application algorithms are then adapted to make use of these distribution range queries, enabling efficient interactive workflows on large-scale data. We show that the proposed technique enables these applications to be scaled primarily in terms of the application result dataset size, rather than the input data size, enabling increased interactivity and scalability.",Histograms;Range queries;Metadata generation;Volume synopsis
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Guiding Deep Brain Stimulation interventions by fusing multimodal uncertainty regions,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a surgical intervention that is known to reduce or eliminate the symptoms of common movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, dystonia, or tremor. During the intervention the surgeon places electrodes inside of the patient's brain to stimulate specific regions. Since these regions span only a couple of millimeters, and electrode misplacement has severe consequences, reliable and accurate navigation is of great importance. Usually the surgeon relies on fused CT and MRI data sets, as well as direct feedback from the patient. More recently Microelectrode Recordings (MER), which support navigation by measuring the electric field of the patient's brain, are also used. We propose a visualization system that fuses the different modalities: imaging data, MER and patient checks, as well as the related uncertainties, in an intuitive way to present placement-related information in a consistent view with the goal of supporting the surgeon in the final placement of the stimulating electrode. We will describe the design considerations for our system, the technical realization, present the outcome of the proposed system, and provide an evaluation.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Discovering and visualizing patterns in EEG data,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Brain activity data is often collected through the use of electroencephalography (EEG). In this data acquisition modality, the electric fields generated by neurons are measured at the scalp. Although this technology is capable of measuring activity from a group of neurons, recent efforts provide evidence that these small neuronal collections communicate with other, distant assemblies in the brain's cortex. These collaborative neural assemblies are often found by examining the EEG record to find shared activity patterns. In this paper, we present a system that focuses on extracting and visualizing potential neural activity patterns directly from EEG data. Using our system, neuroscientists may investigate the spectral dynamics of signals generated by individual electrodes or groups of sensors. Additionally, users may interactively generate queries which are processed to reveal which areas of the brain may exhibit common activation patterns across time and frequency. The utility of this system is highlighted in a case study in which it is used to analyze EEG data collected during a working memory experiment.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,A topologically-enhanced juxtaposition tool for hybrid wind tunnel,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"We have developed a hybrid wind tunnel, where 2D measurement-integrated (MI) simulation, which utilizes actual data acquired from real air flow behind a square cylinder, plays an important role in improving the accuracy of the numerical analysis. The wind tunnel requires an accompanying visual analysis tool with which we can effectively peer into the relationships between the actual and simulated flow fields. In this paper, we attempt to exploit an augmented reality display to that end. The basic idea is to superimpose the computationally-visualized MI simulated pressure field onto the actual flow velocity structure physically-visualized with oil misttraced streaklines instantaneously. Spatial registration of these two visual sources is rather straight-forward since the fixed cylinder of the wind tunnel is easily identified, whereas visualizing the MI simulated pressure field can be characterized with a sophisticated scheme based on differential topology. Considering the fact that vortex centers are located at local minima in the pressure field, and each minimum is surrounded by a derived topological feature called ridge cycle, we can colorize the field adaptively and keep track of Karman vortex streets robustly, regardless of drastic change in the Reynolds number of the flow field.",Differential topology;juxtaposition;transfer function design
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Visualization of piecewise linear interface calculation,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Piecewise linear interface calculation (PLIC) is one of the most widely employed reconstruction schemes for the simulation of multiphase flow. In this visualization paper we focus on the reconstruction from the simulation point of view, i.e., we present a framework for the analysis of this reconstruction scheme together with its implications on the overall simulation. By interpreting PLIC reconstruction as an isosurface extraction problem from the first-order Taylor approximation of the underlying volume of fluid field, we obtain a framework for error analysis and geometric representation of the reconstruction including the fluxes involved in the simulation. At the same time this generalizes PLIC to higher-order approximation. We exemplify the utility and versatility of our visualization approach on several multiphase CFD examples.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Illustrative visualization of cardiac and aortic blood flow from 4D MRI data,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In the last years, illustrative methods have found their way into flow visualization since they communicate difficult information in a comprehensible way. This is of great benefit especially in domains where the audience does not necessarily have flow expertise. One such domain is the medical field where the development of 4D MR imaging (for in-vivo 3D blood flow measurement) lead to an increased demand for easy flow analysis techniques. The goal and the challenge is to transfer the data into simple visualizations supporting the physician with flow interpretation and decision making. In this work, we take one step towards this goal. We present an approach for the illustrative visualization of steady flow features occurring in 4D MRI data of heart and aorta. Like shown in manually created illustrations, we restrict our visualization to the main data characteristics and do not depict every flow detail. The input for our method are flow features extracted from a dataset's complete set of streamlines with the help of line predicates. We create an abstract depiction of these line bundles by selecting a set of bundle representatives reflecting the most important flow aspects. These lines are rendered as three-dimensional arrows that are fused in areas where they represent the same flow. Since vortices are another important flow information for a physician, we identify these regions in the 4D MRI data and display them as unobtrusive, tube-like structures. A hatching texture provides for a visual effect of rotational blood flow. By applying our illustration technique to diverse flow structures of several 4D MRI datasets, we demonstrate that the abstract visualization is useful to gain an easier insight into the data. Feedback of medical experts confirmed the usefulness and revealed limitations of our work. The images are restricted to the essential flow features and, therefore, clearer and less cluttered. Our method has great potential and offers many possible applications, e.g., in comparative visualization and also beyond the medical domain.",Computer Applications [J.3]: Life and Medical Sciences
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,iTree: Exploring time-varying data using indexable tree,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Significant advances have been made in time-varying data analysis and visualization, mainly in improving our ability to identify temporal trends and classify the underlying data. However, the ability to perform cost-effective data querying and indexing is often not incorporated, which posts a serious limitation as the size of time-varying data continue to grow. In this paper, we present a new approach that unifies data compacting, indexing and classification into a single framework. We achieve this by transforming the time-activity curve representation of a time-varying data set into a hierarchical symbolic representation. We further build an indexable version of the data hierarchy, from which we create the iTree for visual representation of the time-varying data. A hyperbolic layout algorithm is employed to draw the iTree with a large number of nodes and provide focus+context visualization for interaction. We achieve effective querying, searching and tracking of time-varying data sets by enabling multiple coordinated views consisting of the iTree, the symbolic view and the spatial view.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Interactive selection of multivariate features in large spatiotemporal data,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Selecting meaningful features is central in the analysis of scientific data. Today's multivariate scientific datasets are often large and complex making it difficult to define general features of interest significant to scientific applications. To address this problem, we propose three general, spatiotemporal metrics to quantify the significant properties of data features-concentration, continuity and co-occurrence, named collectively as CO3. We implemented an interactive visualization system to investigate complex multivariate time-varying data from satellite remote sensing with great spatial resolutions, as well as from real-time continental-scale power grid monitoring with great temporal resolutions. The system integrates CO3 metrics with an elegant multi-space user interaction tool to provide various forms of quantitative user feedback. Through these, the system supports an iterative user-driven analysis process. Our findings demonstrate that the CO3 metrics are useful for simplifying the problem space and revealing potential unknown possibilities of scientific discoveries by assisting users to effectively select significant features and groups of features for visualization and analysis. Users can then comprehend the problem better and design future studies using newly discovered scientific hypotheses.",Multivariate;Interactive Feature Selection;Large Data;Metrics
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Self-organizing maps for multi-objective pareto frontiers,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Decision makers often need to take into account multiple conflicting objectives when selecting a solution for their problem. This can result in a potentially large number of candidate solutions to be considered. Visualizing a Pareto Frontier, the optimal set of solutions to a multi-objective problem, is considered a difficult task when the problem at hand spans more than three objective functions. We introduce a novel visual-interactive approach to facilitate coping with multi-objective problems. We propose a characterization of the Pareto Frontier data and the tasks decision makers face as they reach their decisions. Following a comprehensive analysis of the design alternatives, we show how a semantically-enhanced Self-Organizing Map, can be utilized to meet the identified tasks. We argue that our newly proposed design provides both consistent orientation of the 2D mapping as well as an appropriate visual representation of individual solutions. We then demonstrate its applicability with two real-world multi-objective case studies. We conclude with a preliminary empirical evaluation and a qualitative usefulness assessment.",

IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Visual task solution strategies in tree diagrams,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"We investigate visual task solution strategies when exploring traditional, orthogonal, and radial node-link tree layouts, four orientations of the non-radial layouts, as well as varying difficulty of the task. The strategies are identified by examining eye movement data recorded in a controlled user study previously conducted by Burch et al. For detailed analysis of the spatio-temporal structures and patterns in the eye tracking data, we employ visual analytics techniques adopted from related methodology for geographic movement data by Andrienko et al. In this way, we complement the statistical analysis of task completion times and error rates reported by Burch et al. with spatio-temporal strategies that explain the variation in completion times. We identify differences between task solution strategies dependent on layout type, orientation, and task difficulty. Furthermore, we examine differences between groups of participants split according to completion time. Our analysis identifies that for all layouts it took nearly the same time to find the task solution node, but in the radial layout the solution was not confirmed directly. Instead, a more frequent cross-checking occurs afterwards, which is the main reason for the impaired performance of radial layouts.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Exploring agent-based simulations in political science using Aggregate Temporal Graphs,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Agent-based simulation has become a key technique for modeling and simulating dynamic, complicated behaviors in social and behavioral sciences. As these simulations become more complex, they generate an increasingly large amount of data. Lacking the appropriate tools and support, it has become difficult for social scientists to interpret and analyze the results of these simulations. In this paper, we introduce the Aggregate Temporal Graph (ATG), a graph formulation that can be used to capture complex relationships between discrete simulation states in time. Using this formulation, we can assist social scientists in identifying critical simulation states by examining graph substructures. In particular, we define the concept of a Gateway and its inverse, a Terminal, which capture the relationships between pivotal states in the simulation and their inevitable outcomes. We propose two real-time computable algorithms to identify these relationships and provide a proof of correctness, complexity analysis, and empirical run-time analysis. We demonstrate the use of these algorithms on a large-scale social science simulation of political power and violence in present-day Thailand, and discuss broader applications of the ATG and associated algorithms in other domains such as analytic provenance.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Visual analysis of uncertainties in ocean forecasts for planning and operation of off-shore structures,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"We present a novel integrated visualization system that enables interactive visual analysis of ensemble simulations used in ocean forecasting, i.e, simulations of sea surface elevation. Our system enables the interactive planning of both the placement and operation of off-shore structures. We illustrate this using a real-world simulation of the Gulf of Mexico. Off-shore structures, such as those used for oil exploration, are vulnerable to hazards caused by strong loop currents. The oil and gas industry therefore relies on accurate ocean forecasting systems for planning their operations. Nowadays, these forecasts are based on multiple spatio-temporal simulations resulting in multidimensional, multivariate and multivalued data, so-called ensemble data. Changes in sea surface elevation are a good indicator for the movement of loop current eddies, and our visualization approach enables their interactive exploration and analysis. We enable analysis of the spatial domain, for planning the placement of structures, as well as detailed exploration of the temporal evolution at any chosen position, for the prediction of critical ocean states that require the shutdown of rig operations.",Uncertainty;Ensemble Simulation;Risk Estimate
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,A visual analytics approach to exploring protein flexibility subspaces,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Understanding what causes proteins to change shape and how the resulting shape influences function will expedite the design of more narrowly focused drugs and therapies. Shape alterations are often the result of flexibility changes in a set of localized neighborhoods that may or may not act in concert. Computational models have been developed to predict flexibility changes under varying empirical parameters. In this paper, we tackle a significant challenge facing scientists when analyzing outputs of a computational model, namely how to identify, examine, compare, and group interesting neighborhoods of proteins under different parameter sets. This is a difficult task since comparisons over protein subunits that comprise diverse neighborhoods are often too complex to characterize with a simple metric and too numerous to analyze manually. Here, we present a series of novel visual analytics approaches toward addressing this task. User scenarios illustrate the utility of these approaches and feedback from domain experts confirms their effectiveness.",

Our new visualization approach supports the investigation of both relation types in one diagram. Edge-edge relations are visualized as curves that are directly integrated into the node-link diagram that represents the object-relation structure. In contrast, vertex-vertex relations are illustrated distinguishably from edge-edge relations using straight links as representations. While the shape of links is used to differentiate between the relation types, the weights of the edge-edge relations are mapped to the width and color of the curves. To facilitate an extensive analysis of interrelations, our approach incorporates several interaction techniques that can be used for filtering and highlighting. The usability of our visualization is demonstrated with two case studies in the application domains of bioinformatics and financial services.",Graph visualization;correlation visualization;multi-variate graph data
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,On the faithfulness of graph visualizations,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Readability criteria have been commonly used to measure the quality of graph visualizations. In this paper we argue that readability criteria, while necessary, are not sufficient. We propose a new kind of criterion, generically termed faithfulness, for evaluating graph layout methods. We propose a general model for quantifying faithfulness, and contrast it with the well established readability criteria. We use examples of multidimensional scaling, edge bundling and several other visualization metaphors (including matrix-based and map-based visualizations) to illustrate faithfulness.",faithfulness;readability;task;change faithfulness
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,FlexGD: A flexible force-directed model for graph drawing,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"We propose FlexGD, a force-directed algorithm for straightline undirected graph drawing. The algorithm strives to draw graph layouts encompassing from uniform vertex distribution to extreme structure abstraction. It is flexible for it is parameterized so that the emphasis can be put on either of the two drawing criteria. The parameter determines how much the edges are shorter than the average distance between vertices. Extending the clustering property of the LinLog model, FlexGD is efficient for cluster visualization in an adjustable level. The energy function of FlexGD is minimized through a multilevel approach, particularly designed to work in contexts where edge length distribution is not uniform. Applying FlexGD on several real datasets, we illustrate both the good quality of the layout on various topologies, and the ability of the algorithm to meet the addressed drawing criteria.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,A generative layout approach for rooted tree drawings,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"In response to the large number of existing tree layouts, generic â€œmeta-layoutsâ€ have recently been proposed. These generic approaches utilize layout design spaces to pinpoint a tree drawing with desired characteristics in the wealth of available drawing options and parameters. While design-space-based generic layouts work well for the confined set of implicit space-filling tree layouts, they have so far eluded their extension to explicit node-link diagrams. In order to produce both, implicit and explicit tree layouts, this paper parts with the descriptive nature of the design spaces and instead takes a generative approach based on operators. As these operators can be combined into operator sequences and be used at different stages of the layout process, a small operator set already suffices to yield a large number of different tree layouts. To this end, we present a generic tree layout pipeline and give examples of suitable layout operators to plug into the pipeline. A prototypical implementation of our pipeline and operators is presented, and it is illustrated with space-filling and node-link examples. Furthermore, the paper presents results from a user study evaluating our generative approach as it is realized by the prototype.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,FlowGraph: A compound hierarchical graph for flow field exploration,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Visual exploration of large and complex 3D flow fields is critically important for understanding many aero- and hydro-dynamical systems that dominate various physical and natural phenomena in the world. In this paper, we introduce the FlowGraph, a novel compound graph representation that organizes streamline clusters and spatial regions hierarchically for occlusion-free and controllable visual exploration. Our approach works with any seeding strategies as long as the domain is well covered and important flow features are captured. By transforming a flow field to a graph representation, we enable observation and exploration of the relationships among streamline clusters, spatial regions and their interconnection in the transformed space. The FlowGraph not only provides a visual mapping that abstracts streamline clusters and spatial regions in various levels of detail, but also serves as a navigation tool that guides flow field exploration and understanding. Through brushing and linking in conjunction with the spatial streamline view, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FlowGraph with several visual exploration and comparison tasks that can not be well accomplished using the streamline view alone. As occlusion and clutter are almost ubiquitous in 3D flows, the FlowGraph represents a promising direction for enhancing our ability to understand large and complex flow field data.",

Using data-driven deformations we obtain flow-orthogonal and flow-tangential surfaces by a flux-based optimization. Surfaces are positioned interactively and deformed in real-time according to local flow. The deformed surfaces are particularly useful for defining seed structures. We show how the same gradient-based computational framework can be applied to obtain parametrizations of flow-aligned surfaces. This way it is easy to define nontrivial seed structures for integration-based flow visualization methods. Additionally, the flow-aligned parametrizations are employed for view-independent surface-based LIC visualizations. We apply our method to a number of data sets to show the effectiveness of our deformations and parametrization-based seed extraction methods for interactive flow exploration.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2013,Visualizing linear neighborhoods in non-linear vector fields,PACIFICVIS - Pacific Visualization Symposium,B,"Linear approximation plays an important role in many areas employing numerical algorithms. Particularly in the field of vector field visualization, it is the basis of widely used techniques. In this paper, we introduce two methods to extract areas in two- and three-dimensional vector fields that are connected to linear flow behavior. We propose a region-growing algorithm that extracts the linear neighborhood for a certain position. The region is characterized by linear flow behavior up to a user-defined approximation threshold. While this first method computes the size of a region given the mentioned threshold, our second method computes the quality of a linear approximation given a user-defined n-ring neighborhood. The scalar field resulting from the second method is, therefore, called affine linear approximation error. Isosurfaces of this field show regions of close-to-linear and non-linear flow behavior. We demonstrate the expressiveness and discuss the properties of the extracted regions using analytical examples and several datasets from the domain of computational fluid dynamics (CFD).",

In this paper, we show that statistical distributions of measurements along the trajectory of a streamline can be used as a robust and effective descriptor to measure the similarity between streamlines. With the distribution-based approach, we present a framework for interactive exploration of 3D vector fields with streamline query and clustering. Streamline queries allow us to rapidly identify streamlines that share similar geometric features to the target streamline. Streamline clustering allows us to group together streamlines of similar shapes. Based on user's selection, different clusters with different features at different levels of detail can be visualized to highlight features in 3D flow fields.

The visualization combines two major perspectives: Large scale trends based on a strongly simplified field as background visualization and a local visualization highlighting strongly expressed features at their exact position. Each component considers the vector field itself and its spatial derivatives. The derivate is an asymmetric tensor field, which allows the deduction of scalar quantities reflecting distinctive field properties like strength of rotation or shear. The basis of the background visualization is a vector and scalar clustering approach. The local features are defined as the extrema of the respective scalar fields. Applying scalar field topology provides a profound mathematical basis for the feature extraction. All design decisions are guided by the goal of generating a simple to read visualization. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show results for three different data sets with different complexity and characteristics.",

However, it is crucial to understand the factors influencing user experience in AR applications. To optimize user experience, we conducted a user study where participants adjusted parameters to determine noticeable and disruptive values of latency, registration accuracy, and jitter using a mobile indirect AR prototype that simulates a rugby stadium experience. Our findings indicate that latency has the highest disruptive impact on usersa experience, with registration accuracy following closely. Furthermore, when noticeable latency, registration accuracy, and jitter were combined, the user experience was negatively affected in a nonlinear, combinatorial manner. This suggests that addressing factors individually is necessary but not enough for successful user experiences.

In this article, we explore the question of how different shape representations affect the aesthetic judgments of shape pairs. Specifically, we compare human responses to perceptual aesthetics judgments on 3-D shapes in pairs presented in different 3-D shape representation, such as voxels, points, wireframe, and polygon. In contrast to our own previous work [Dev et al. (2017)] that explores this question for a few shape classes, this article analyzes a larger number of shape classes. Our key finding is that human aesthetics judgments on relatively low resolution of points or voxels are comparable to polygon meshes, which implies that humans can often make their aesthetics decisions based on relatively coarse representations of the shapes. Our results have implications toward the data collection process of pairwise aesthetics data and the further use of such data in shape aesthetics and 3-D modeling problems.  © 1981-2012 IEEE.",

Based on these graphical capabilities, generative design driven by evolutionary computation can also be visually illustrated to give students a glimpse into how artificial intelligence is transforming engineering design. The article provides real-world examples in the field of sustainable energy engineering based on Aladdin, an open-source design and analysis Web app. It also presents evidence of learning from pilot tests at culturally diverse high schools. Science educators interested in incorporating engineering design into their lesson plans may find this article helpful.  © 1981-2012 IEEE.",

Applying hybrid AR/VR technologies in fire drill training may be beneficial because they can overcome limitations such as space-time constraints, risk factors, training costs, and difficulties in real environments. The proposed system can improve training effectiveness by transforming arbitrary real spaces into real-time, realistic virtual fire situations and by interacting with tangible training props. Moreover, the system can create intelligent and realistic fire effects in AR by estimating not only the object type but also its physical properties.

This decision is based on which area should be used, which restrictions exist, and which conditions have to be fulfilled for reusing this area. Information about the restrictions and the conditions is available as mostly textual, nonspatial data associated to areas overlapping the target areas. Due to the large amount of possible combinations of restrictions and conditions overlapping (partially) the target area, this decision process becomes quite tedious and cumbersome. Moreover, it proves to be useful to identify similar regions that have reached different stages of development within the dataset which in turn allows determining common tasks for these regions. We support the experts in accomplishing these tasks by providing aggregated representations as well as multiple coordinated views together with category filters and selection mechanisms implemented in an interactive decision support system. Textual information is linked to these visualizations enabling the experts to justify their decisions. Evaluating our approach using a standard SUS questionnaire suggests that especially the experts were very satisfied with the interactive decision support system.  © 1981-2012 IEEE.",

While dashboards are typically designed for data consumption, our findings show that dashboard users have far more diverse needs. To capture these activities, we frame data workersâÂ€Â™ practices as data conversations: conversations with data capture classic analysis (asking and answering data questions), while conversations through and around data involve constructing representations and narratives for sharing and communication.

Scopus,journalPaper,2023,Enhancing the Sense of Presence in Virtual Reality,CG&A - Computer Graphics and Applications,B,"The vision of virtual reality, since Ivan Sutherland's first head mounted device in 1968, has been the re-creation of reality, something indistinguishable from reality, akin to what was depicted in the 1999 film, The Matrix. However, researchers and developers have largely favored visual perception over other senses, leading to the design of virtual worlds that perhaps look real but do not feel real. This favoring of the visual sense and more recently visual and audio senses, overlooks theory in psychology and phenomenology that places embodied action at the center of perception. That is to say, it is the virtual environment's ability to support and enable user actions that impacts perception and perhaps by extension, the user's sense of presence, not just the visual fidelity. Starting with Gibson's approach to action-based perception, we proposed a 4-D framework for creating virtual reality experiences that seamlessly blend extrinsic elements such as the user's real world context with intrinsic elements such as the hardware specifications, application, and interactive content, with the goal to enable a higher sense of presence.  © 1981-2012 IEEE.",

Specifically, we present a novel nested matrix design that overviews the graph structure differences over a time period as well as shows graph structure details in the timeslices of user interest. By collectively considering the overall temporal evolution and structure details in each timeslice, an optimization-based node reordering strategy is developed to group nodes with similar evolution patterns and highlight interesting graph structure details in each timeslice.

The paper argued that the rainbow colormap's characteristics of confusing the viewer, obscuring the data and actively misleading interpretation make it a poor choice for visualization. Subsequent articles often repeat and extend these arguments, so much so that avoiding rainbow colormaps, along with their derivatives, has become dogma in the visualization community. Despite this loud and persistent recommendation, scientists continue to use rainbow colormaps. Have we failed to communicate our message, or do rainbow colormaps offer advantages that have not been fully appreciated? We argue that rainbow colormaps have properties that are underappreciated by existing design conventions. We explore key critiques of the rainbow in the context of recent research to understand where and how rainbows might be misunderstood.

Prior work has found that different methods of visualizing uncertain information can produce different patterns of decision making from users. However, uncertainty can also be represented via text or numerical information, and few studies have systematically compared these types of representations to visualizations of uncertainty. We present two experiments that compared visual representations of risk (icon arrays) to numerical representations (natural frequencies) in a wildfire evacuation task. Like prior studies, we found that different types of visual cues led to different patterns of decision making. In addition, our comparison of visual and numerical representations of risk found that people were more likely to evacuate when they saw visualizations than when they saw numerical representations.

This article introduces a virtual flavor device to simulate real flavor experiences. The goal is to provide virtual flavor experiences, using food-safe chemicals for the three components of a flavor (taste, aroma, mouthfeel), which are perceived as 'indistinguishable' from the equivalent real experience. Furthermore, because we are delivering a simulation, the same device can be used to take a user on a 'flavor discovery journey' from a start flavor to a new, preferred flavor by adding or removing any amount of the components. In the first experiment, participants (N = 28) were exposed to real and virtual samples of orange juice, and the health product, rooibos tea, and asked to rate their similarity. The second experiment investigated how participants (N = 6) could move within 'flavor space' from one flavor to another. The results show that it is possible to simulate, with a high degree of precision, a real flavor experience, and precisely controlled 'flavor discovery journeys' can be undertaken using virtual flavors. © 1981-2012 IEEE.",
Scopus,journalPaper,2023,Quantum Computing and Visualization: A Disruptive Technological Change Ahead,CG&A - Computer Graphics and Applications,B,"The focus of this Visualization Viewpoints article is to provide some background on quantum computing (QC), to explore ideas related to how visualization helps in understanding QC, and examine how QC might be useful for visualization with the growth and maturation of both technologies in the future. In a quickly evolving technology landscape, QC is emerging as a promising pathway to overcome the growth limits in classical computing. In some cases, QC platforms offer the potential to vastly outperform the familiar classical computer by solving problems more quickly or that may be intractable on any known classical platform. As further performance gains for classical computing platforms are limited by diminishing Moore's Law scaling, QC platforms might be viewed as a potential successor to the current field of exascale-class platforms. While present-day QC hardware platforms are still limited in scale, the field of quantum computing is robust and rapidly advancing in terms of hardware capabilities, software environments for developing quantum algorithms, and educational programs for training the next generation of scientists and engineers. After a brief introduction to QC concepts, the focus of this article is to explore the interplay between the fields of visualization and QC. First, visualization has played a role in QC by providing the means to show representations of the quantum state of single-qubits in superposition states and multiple-qubits in entangled states. Second, there are a number of ways in which the field of visual data exploration and analysis may potentially benefit from this disruptive new technology though there are challenges going forward.  © 1981-2012 IEEE.",

Scopus,journalPaper,2023,Visualization and Decision Making Design Under Uncertainty,CG&A - Computer Graphics and Applications,B,"Uncertainty is an important aspect to data understanding. Without awareness of the variability, error, or reliability of a dataset, the ability to make decisions on that data is limited. However, practices around uncertainty visualization remain domain-specific, rooted in convention, and in many instances, absent entirely. Part of the reason for this may be a lack of established guidelines for navigating difficult choices of when uncertainty should be added, how to visualize uncertainty, and how to evaluate its effectiveness. Unsurprisingly, the inclusion of uncertainty into visualizations is a major challenge to visualization. As work concerned with uncertainty visualization grows, it has become clear that simple visual additions of uncertainty information to traditional visualization methods do not appropriately convey the meaning of the uncertainty, pose many perceptual challenges, and, in the worst case, can lead a viewer to a completely wrong understanding of the data. These challenges are the driving motivator for this special issue.  © 1981-2012 IEEE.",

To provide a sense of the shape of handheld objects, a haptic device that changes weight distribution is proposed. It is known that the visual feedback enhances the haptic sensation of shape, and it is also known that it does for morphing shape as well. Our previous publication presented a perception model for the static shape of a virtual object. In this article, we extend the model to produce a plausible sense of the morphing shape of handheld objects. Our stochastic model predicts the proper weight actuation for the weight-shifting haptic device, which users can plausibly feel while reducing hardware effort. We evaluated our perception model and resulted in the model accuracy average of 8.1% error. Using this perception model, the amount of weight actuation at 75% probability of plausibility is reduced up to 37%. © 2022 IEEE.",

In response, they are turning to technology (e.g., RADAR imagery from the Canadian RADARSAT satellite) to augment their traditional knowledge of the ice and to map potential hazards. The difficulty lies in the actual RADAR interpretation process. In order to support understanding of the RADAR image content, we introduce a work-in-progress (WIP), INTUIT, a physicalization that represents the RADAR reflection strength, which is highly influenced by surface roughness, as a tactile texture. Such tactile texture is made by resampling the RADAR imagery to a number of UV cells and mapping the average brightness value of each cell to a physical variable. A proof of concept was designed for a region in Baffin Island (Nunavut) and sent to the Arctic for initial feedback.

Since seeing certain details requires bringing the camera close to the physical objects, the resulting camera frames may lack the visual information necessary to determine objects∞ positions and accurately superimpose the overlay. We address this by enhancing tracking of 3-D prints at close distances and employing visualization techniques that allow viewing small details in ways that do not interfere with tracking. To demonstrate these techniques, we apply our framework to the preservation of two heritage sites that represent large real-life areas containing smaller details of interest.  © 1981-2012 IEEE.",

Methods for constructing 2-layer drawings often try to minimize the number of edge crossings. We use vertex splitting to reduce the number of crossings, by replacing selected vertices on one layer by two (or more) copies and suitably distributing their incident edges among these copies. We study several optimization problems related to vertex splitting, either minimizing the number of crossings or removing all crossings with fewest splits.

More precisely, our goal is to answer the following questions: 1) Are people feeling more comfortable with more recent CG characters than the older ones? 2) Does charisma or familiarity with virtual humans correlate with perceived comfort? To answer these questions, we first replicated an experiment from 2012 and compared the perception concerning CG characters then and now, and then we included images of more recent CG characters in our analysis. Our results indicate that the perceived comfort increased over time when comparing the characters of 2012 and 2020. However, it did not change significantly for the characters of 2012. In addition, we found a correlation between perceived charisma and familiarity, at all levels of realism, and between charisma and comfort. Interestingly, more charisma was perceived in videos than in images. In addition, unrealistic characters were also perceived as more charismatic. © 2021 IEEE.",Animation; Faces; Games; Motion pictures; Robots; Videos; Visualization

The value of a chart also often comes from higher level derived encodings, and which encodings end up getting used also depends on the usera's task.  © 1981-2012 IEEE.",
Scopus,journalPaper,2021,DeepGD: A Deep Learning Framework for Graph Drawing Using GNN,CG&A - Computer Graphics and Applications,B,"In the past decades, many graph drawing techniques have been proposed for generating aesthetically pleasing graph layouts. However, it remains a challenging task since different layout methods tend to highlight different characteristics of the graphs. Recently, studies on deep-learning-based graph drawing algorithms have emerged but they are often not generalizable to arbitrary graphs without retraining. In this article, we propose a Convolutional-Graph-Neural-Network-based deep learning framework, DeepGD, which can draw arbitrary graphs once trained. It attempts to generate layouts by compromising among multiple prespecified aesthetics considering a good graph layout usually complies with multiple aesthetics simultaneously. In order to balance the tradeoff, we propose two adaptive training strategies, which adjust the weight factor of each aesthetic dynamically during training. The quantitative and qualitative assessment of DeepGD demonstrates that it is capable of drawing arbitrary graphs effectively, while being flexible at accommodating different aesthetic criteria.  © 1981-2012 IEEE.",

Traditionally, the contact of solids is approximately modeled with linearized geometric information near the contacting regions. This approximation is prone to generating underconstrained or overconstrained subproblems that can produce interpenetrating or numerically unstable results, especially when large deformation of solids is also present. To avoid these issues, we propose incremental potential contact (IPC) by formulating a mathematically consistent and general noninterpenetration constraint based on precisely calculated unsigned distances between boundary elements. IPC applies a customized barrier potential to directly relate the distances to the contact forces, which can grow infinitely large as the distance approaches zero to guarantee noninterpenetration. Results show reliable contact simulation even with versatile materials, large timestep sizes, fast impact velocities, severe deformation, and varying boundary conditions""bringing the intricate and important dynamical details to computer graphics in a reliable way for the first time.  © 1981-2012 IEEE.",

Virtual pottery involves meeting two conflicting constraints: rapid visualization during modeling and accurate rapid prototyping during manufacturing. Artists simultaneously need both low polygon shape representation for interactive visualization and adequate representation for generating accurate printable models. Artists also face the additional complexities of adding surface details that cannot be achieved by hand and handling materials like clay used in the manufacturing of real pottery.

Building scenes have strong occlusion features and the building exterior plays an important role in digital devices with limited computational resources. This allows the possibility to reduce the resource consumption while roaming in outdoor scenes by culling away the interior building data. This article addresses the task of automatic annotation of BIM building exterior via voxel index analysis. We showcase the research of using industry foundation classes (IFC) and other mainstream formats as our input data and proposed an automatic algorithm for annotating the building exterior. Afterward, a practical and accurate voxel index analysis procedure is designed for frequently flawed models. The annotation can be added directly into the original data file under the same IFC standard, avoiding the complex procedure and information loss in semantics mapping between different standards.

Keypoint-based object pose estimation has demonstrated its effectiveness in dealing with it. However, current approaches first estimate the keypoints through a neural network and further compute the interframe pose change via least-squares optimization. They estimate rotation and translation in the same way, ignoring the differences between them. In this work, we propose a keypoint-based disentangled pose network, which disentangles the 6-D object pose change to 3-D rotation and 3-D translation. Specifically, the translation is directly estimated by the network and the rotation is indirectly calculated by singular value decomposition according to the keypoints.

Example-based methods usually employ a database of prerecorded sequences that are concatenated or looped in order to synthesize novel animations. In contrast to this traditional example-based approach, we introduce a light-weight auto-regressive network to transform our animation-database into a parametric model. During training, our network learns the dynamics of facial expressions, which enables the replay of annotated sequences from our animation database as well as their seamless concatenation in new order. This representation is especially useful for the synthesis of visual speech, where coarticulation creates interdependencies between adjacent visemes, which affects their appearance. Instead of creating an exhaustive database that contains all viseme variants, we use our animation-network to predict the correct appearance.

While the existing 2-D caricature facial expression editing methods are mostly realized by expression interpolation from the original image to the target image, expression extrapolation has rarely been studied before. In this article, we propose a novel expression extrapolation method for caricature facial expressions based on the Kendall shape space, in which the key idea is to introduce a representation for the 3-D expression model to remove rigid transformations, such as translation, scaling, and rotation, from the Kendall shape space. Built upon the proposed representation, the 2-D caricature expression extrapolation process can be controlled by the 3-D model reconstructed from the input 2-D caricature image and the exaggerated expressions of the caricature images generated based on the extrapolated expression of a 3-D model that is robust to facial poses in the Kendall shape space; this 3-D model can be calculated with tools such as exponential mapping in Riemannian space. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively and automatically extrapolate facial expressions in caricatures with high consistency and fidelity. In addition, we derive 3-D facial models with diverse expressions and expand the scale of the original FaceWarehouse database.

We develop a visualization tool for hyperspectral images based on neural networks, which allows a user to specify the regions of interest, select bands of interest, and obtain hyperspectral classification results in a scatterplot generated from hyperspectral features. A cascade neural network is trained to generate a scatterplot that matches the cluster centers labeled by the user. The inferred scatterplot not only shows the clusters of points, but also reveals relationships of substances. The trained neural network can be reused for time-varying hyperspectral data analysis without retraining.

In this work, an alternative approach to this problem is proposed whereby clouds are synthesized using a learned data-driven representation.

Initially designed to represent and navigate through scientific publications in different disciplines, Cartolabe has evolved to become a generic framework and accommodate various corpora, ranging from Wikipedia (4.5M entries) to the French National Debate (4.3M entries). Cartolabe is made of two modules: The first relies on natural language processing methods, converting a corpus and its entities (documents, authors, and concepts) into high-dimensional vectors, computing their projection on the two-dimensional plane, and extracting meaningful labels for regions of the plane. The second module is a web-based visualization, displaying tiles computed from the multidimensional projection of the corpus using the Umap projection method. This visualization module aims at enabling users with no expertise in visualization and data analysis to get an overview of their corpus, and to interact with it: exploring, querying, filtering, panning, and zooming on regions of semantic interest. Three use cases are discussed to illustrate Cartolabe's versatility and ability to bring large-scale textual corpus visualization and exploration to a wide audience. © 1981-2012 IEEE.",

VR aims to generate stimuli that appear to come from a source other than the interface through which they are delivered. The synthetic stimuli replace real-world stimuli, and transport the user to another, perhaps imaginary, place. To do this, we must overcome many challenges, often related to matching the synthetic stimuli to the expectations and behavior of the real world. One way in which the stimuli can fail is its latency-the time between a user's action and the computer's response. We constructed a novel VR renderer, that optimized latency above all else. Our prototype allowed us to explore how latency affects human-computer interaction.

Next the boundary color of the first frame is transferred to the subsequent frames by matching the curves. Finally, with the original or modified Poisson regions, we render the video using an efficient random-access Poisson solver. Thanks to our efficient diffusion curve matching algorithm, transferring colors for the vectorized video takes less than 1 millisecond per frame. Our method is particularly desired for frequent transfer from multiple references due to its information reuse nature. The simple diffusion curve matching also greatly improves the performance of video vectorization, since we only need to solve an optimization problem for the first frame. Since our method does not require correspondence between the reference image/video and the input video, it is flexible and robust to handle faces with significantly different geometries and postures, which often pose challenges to the existing methods. Moreover, by manipulating Poisson regions, we can enhance or reduce the highlight and contrast so that the reference color can fit into the input video naturally. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on image-to-video transfer and color swap in videos.  © 1981-2012 IEEE.",color transfer; diffusion curves; optimal mass transportation; Poisson vector graphics; Portrait videos
Scopus,journalPaper,2020,Close reading for visualization evaluation,CG&A - Computer Graphics and Applications,B,"Visualizations produced by collaborations between artists, scientists, and visualization experts lay claim to being not only more effective in delivering information but also more effective in their abilities to elicit qualities like human connection. However, as prior work in the visualization community has demonstrated, it is difficult to evaluate these claims because characteristics associated with human connection are not easily measured quantitatively. In this Visualization Viewpoints piece, we address this problem in the context of our work to develop methods of evaluating visualizations created by Sculpting Visualization, a multidisciplinary project that incorporates art and design theory and practice into the process of scientific visualization. We present the design and results of a study in which we used close reading, a formal methodology used by humanities scholars, as a way to test reactions and analyses from evaluation participants related to an image created using Sculpting Visualization.

Interactive visualization of these large datasets, however, is challenging without degradation in visual fidelity. A common solution is to fit the dataset into available video memory by downsampling and compression. The achievable reproduction accuracy is thereby limited for interactive scenarios, such as immersive exploration in virtual reality (VR). This degradation in visual realism ultimately hinders the effective communication of human cultural knowledge. This article presents a method to render 3-D scan datasets with minimal loss of visual fidelity. A point-based rendering approach visualizes scan data as a dense splat cloud. For improved surface approximation of thin and sparsely sampled objects, we propose oriented 3-D ellipsoids as rendering primitives. To render massive texture datasets, we present a virtual texturing system that dynamically loads required image data. It is paired with a single-pass page prediction method that minimizes visible texturing artifacts. Our system renders a challenging dataset in the order of 70 million points and a texture size of 1.2 TB consistently at 90 frames per second in stereoscopic VR. © 1981-2012 IEEE.",3D reconstruction; point-based rendering; virtual reality; virtual texturing

Once trained, the musician can identify pitches, melodies, chords and rhythms by listening to music segments. In a conventional setting, the tutor would teach a trainee the intervals using a musical instrument, typically a piano. However, this is expensive, time consuming and non-engaging for either party. With the emergence of new technologies, including Virtual Reality (VR) and areas such as edutainment, this and similar trainings can be transformed into a more engaging, more accessible, customisable (virtual) environments, with addition of new cues and bespoke progression settings. In this work, we designed and implemented a VR ear training system for interval recognition. The usability, user experience and the effect of \tc{multimodal integration through} addition of a perceptual cue - spatial audio, was investigated in two experiments with 46 participants. The results show that the system is highly acceptable and provides a very good experience for users. Furthermore, we show that the added spatial auditory cues provided in the VR application give users significantly more information for judging the musical intervals, something that is not possible in a non-VR environment.

The challenge of view-based 3-D shape retrieval is that the shape information of each view is limited due to information deficiency in projection. Traditional methods in this direction mostly convert the model into a panoramic view, making it hard to recognize the original shape. To resolve this problem, we propose a novel deep neural network, recurrent panorama network (RePanoNet), which can learn to build panoramic representation from view sequences. A view sequence is rendered at a circle around the model to provide enough panoramic information. For each view sequence, we employ the bidirectional long short-term memory in RePanoNet to recognize spatial correlations between adjacent views to construct a panoramic feature.

Even high-level, dedicated visualization tools often require users to manually select among data attributes, decide which transformations to apply, and specify mappings between visual encoding variables and raw or transformed attributes. In this paper we introduce Data2Vis, an end-to-end trainable neural translation model for automatically generating visualizations from given datasets. We formulate visualization generation as a language translation problem, where data specifications are mapped to visualization specifications in a declarative language (Vega-Lite). To this end, we train a multilayered attention-based encoder-decoder network with long short-term memory (LSTM) units on a corpus of visualization specifications. Qualitative results show that our model learns the vocabulary and syntax for a valid visualization specification, appropriate transformations (count, bins, mean), and how to use common data selection patterns that occur within data visualizations.

Unfortunately, advanced image segmentation methods are not widely applied in research applications as they often miss features, such as uncertainty communication, and may lack an intuitive approach for the use of the underlying algorithm. To solve this problem, this paper fuses a fuzzy and a hierarchical segmentation approach together, thus providing a flexible multiclass segmentation method based on probabilistic path propagations. By utilizing this method, analysts and physicians can map their mental model of image components and their composition to higher level objects. The probabilistic segmentation of higher order components is propagated along the user-defined hierarchy to highlight the potential of improvement resulting in each level of hierarchy by providing an intuitive representation.

In our framework, mesh deformation is decoupled into an iteration of interlaced steps of local projection and global blending.

A convolutional neural network architecture is proposed and trained on a benchmark dataset of graph images, which is composed of synthetically generated graphs and graphs created by sampling from real large networks. Multiple representative readability metrics (including edge crossing, node spread, and group overlap) are considered in the proposed approach. We quantitatively compare our approach to traditional methods and qualitatively evaluate our approach by showing usage scenarios and visualizing convolutional layers. This paper is a first step towards using deep learning based methods to quantitatively evaluate images from the visualization field. © 2019 IEEE.",

Participants were able to trace most of the observable vascular structure, and consistently identified blood vessels down to diameters of 1 mm, an important requirement in diagnosing vascular diseases. Qualitative feedback from our participants suggests that our VR visualization is easy to understand and allows intuitive data exploration, but complex user interactions remained a challenge.

In this paper, we focus on a more challenging and ill-posed problem that is to synthesize surrounding novel viewpoints from a single image. To achieve this goal, we design a full resolution network to extract fine-scale image features, which contributes to prevent blurry artifacts. We also involve a pretrained relative depth estimation network, thus three-dimensional information is utilized to infer the flow field between the input and the target image. Since the depth network is trained by depth order between any pair of objects, large-scale image features are also involved in our system. Finally, a synthesis layer is used to not only warp the observed pixels to the desired positions but also hallucinate the missing pixels from other recorded pixels. Experiments show that our technique successfully synthesizes reasonable novel viewpoints surrounding the input, while other state-of-the-art techniques fail. © 1981-2012 IEEE.",

However, the choice of model is critical in such situations. What if the model chosen is suboptimal for the task, dataset, or question being asked? What if instead of parameterizing and steering this model, a different model provides a better fit?

Scopus,journalPaper,2018,Transient convolutional imaging,CG&A - Computer Graphics and Applications,B,"While traditional imaging systems directly measure scene properties, computational imaging systems add computation to the measurement process, allowing such systems to extract nontrivially encoded scene features. This work demonstrates that exploiting the structure in this process allows us to recover information that is conventionally considered to be 'lost.' Relying on temporally and spatially convolutional structure, we extract a novel image modality that was essentially 'invisible' before: a new temporal dimension of light propagation, obtained with consumer depth cameras. Using conventional time-of-flight cameras, a few seconds of capture and computation allow us to recover information that before could only be acquired in hours of capture time with specialized instrumentation at orders of magnitude higher cost. The novel type of image we capture allows us to make the first steps toward the full inversion of light transport. Specifically, we demonstrate that non-line-of-sight imaging and imaging in scattering media can be made feasible with the temporally resolved light transport acquired using time-of-flight depth cameras. © 1981-2012 IEEE.",

Although the success rate is not statistically different, some adaptations occurred in the way the users performed the task, depending on the visual conditions. In the third-person perspective visual condition, the release parameters indicate that the users more accurately estimated distance to target. Adding visual guidance information (gradual depth information showing the ideal ball trajectory) also led to more natural motor behavior.

However, users may want to focus on important nodes and their connections to groups of other nodes for some applications. For this purpose, it is effective to separately visualize the key nodes detected based on adjacency and attributes of the nodes. This article presents a graph visualization technique for attribute-embedded graphs that applies a graph-clustering algorithm that accounts for the combination of connections and attributes. The graph clustering step divides the nodes according to the commonality of connected nodes and similarity of feature value vectors. It then calculates the distances between arbitrary pairs of clusters according to the number of connecting edges and the similarity of feature value vectors and finally places the clusters based on the distances. Consequently, the technique separates important nodes that have connections to multiple large clusters and improves the visibility of such nodes' connections.

This paper presents CraMs, an application using a new craniometric approach based on 3D models of the skull. The main objective is to obtain, through a process supervised by anthropologists, the main points of interest used to compute craniometric measurements. The application aids this process by analyzing the skull geometry and automatically providing points of interest. The application also allows for semiautomatic point detection, where the user provides an initial guess that might be refined based on the curvature of the skull, as well as the manual selection of any other points of interest. Moreover, results comparing measurements obtained with CraMs and traditional craniometry methods on eight skulls suggest that the application provides comparable craniometric measurements and lower inter-observer variability.

In this context, augmented reality (AR) is one of the most suitable solutions. However, it is still not ready to be effectively used in industry. A crucial problem is the legibility of text seen through AR head-worn displays (HWDs). AR interface designers have no standard guidelines to follow, especially for these devices. Literature and anecdotal evidence suggest that legibility depends mainly on background, display technology (that is, see-through optical or video HWDs), and text style (for example, plain text, outline, or billboard). Furthermore, there are constraints to consider in industrial environments, such as standard color-coding practices and workplace lighting. The authors examine aspects affecting text legibility with an emphasis on deriving guidelines to support AR interface designers. Their results suggest that enhancing text contrast via software, along with using the outline or billboard style, is an effective practice to improve legibility in many situations. If one text style is needed for both types of HWD, their results suggest that colored billboards (with neutral white text) are effective. When color coding is not mandatory, white text and blue billboard are more effective than other styles tested. © 1981-2012 IEEE.",augmented reality; computer graphics; head-worn displays; human-computer interface; Industrie 4.0; mixed reality; style guides; usability engineering; vision I/O

In this article, the authors propose a novel method to solve this challenging problem that lies at the frontiers of outlier detection and clustering of similar groups.

The thesis results in the internalization of the literature, tools, methodology, and work methods for one topic, and a list of future ideas.

To succeed, the student needs to discover and adopt some simple management scheme. Maintaining overall control of the timeline. Breaking the thesis into major tasks allows the student to track date promised versus actual date completed. Researchers must structure time to optimize intermediate long-term working memory. A method for maintaining overall control of the timeline is to break the thesis into major tasks and estimate the date when each will be finished. The presentation of a thesis should have structure, but often too much of the scaffolding by which this structure was achieved is left in place and it overwhelms the content, how a section fits into the whole, what it's going to do, and how it did it is elaborated with such earnest, didactic detail that all one can see is scaffolding.",

The framework incorporates tone mapping, chroma correction, and gamut management to process an HDR image for a given output gamut. The input to the method is an HDR image given in linear XYZ coordinates. First, the image's luminance channel, denoted I(L), is compressed using any existing TMO. The resulting image's chroma channel I(C) is then corrected with the chroma compression algorithm to correct for unwanted saturation resulting from the tone-mapping process. Finally, image chroma and luminance values I(C, L) are processed in a gamut-management step to ensure that all pixels fit within the target gamut boundaries, denoted G(C, L), while minimizing appearance changes in the image. The solution also allows for flexibility in the choice of compressive function: different functions can lead to different image appearances.

This partitioning is based on a visual-saliency map; accordingly, the method labels the patches as important or unimportant. Then, the method scales the important patches as uniformly as possible and stretches or squeezes the unimportant patches to fit the target size.

More important, 3D fingerprint models contain more biometric information than traditional 2D fingerprint images. However, current approaches to fingerprint feature detection usually must transform the 3D models to a 2D space through unwrapping or other methods, which might introduce distortions. A new approach directly extracts valley-ridge features from point-cloud-based 3D fingerprint models. It first applies the moving least-squares method to fit a local paraboloid surface and represent the local point cloud area. It then computes the local surface's curvatures and curvature tensors to facilitate detection of the potential valley and ridge points. The approach projects those points to the most likely valley-ridge lines, using statistical means such as covariance analysis and cross correlation. To finally extract the valley-ridge lines, it grows the polylines that approximate the projected feature points and removes the perturbations between the sampled points. Experiments with different 3D fingerprint models demonstrate this approach's feasibility and performance. © 1981-2012 IEEE.",3D fingerprints; computer graphics; curvatures; feature detection; fingerprint detection; valley-ridge lines

Scopus,journalPaper,2013,Adding a solar-radiance function to the Hošek-Wilkie skylight model,CG&A - Computer Graphics and Applications,B,"One prerequisite for realistic renderings of outdoor scenes is the proper capturing of the sky's appearance. Currently, an explicit simulation of light scattering in the atmosphere isn't computationally feasible, and won't be in the foreseeable future. Captured luminance patterns have proven their usefulness in practice but can't meet all user needs. To fill this capability gap, computer graphics technology has employed analytical models of sky-dome luminance patterns for more than two decades. For technical reasons, such models deal with only the sky dome's appearance, though, and exclude the solar disc. The widely used model proposed by Arcot Preetham and colleagues employed a separately derived analytical formula for adding a solar emitter of suitable radiant intensity. Although this yields reasonable results, the formula is derived in a manner that doesn't exactly match the conditions in their sky-dome model. But the more sophisticated a skylight model is and the more subtly it can represent different conditions, the more the solar radiance should exactly match the skylight's conditions. Toward that end, researchers propose a solar-radiance function that exactly matches a recently published high-quality analytical skylight model. © 1981-2012 IEEE.",computer graphics; skylight models; solar radiance
