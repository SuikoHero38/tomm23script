Scopus,conferencePaper,2023,Securing Data Exchange in the Convergence of Metaverse and IoT Applications,"ARES - International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security",B,"The convergence of Metaverse and Internet of Things (IoT) presents new opportunities for exchanging data, but it also introduces unprecedented security challenges. With the proliferation of IoT devices, the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches is on the rise, posing significant threats to data confidentiality and integrity. To address these challenges and protect user privacy, comprehensive security solutions are essential. We propose the SafeMetaNet approach, which combines proximity-based authentication, encryption, and blockchain technology to establish secure data exchange in the IoT-Metaverse convergence. SafeMetaNet ensures data confidentiality and integrity through encryption and establishes a tamper-proof record of data exchange using blockchain technology. We evaluated the approach's performance using various metrics, including latency, throughput, and two security metrics: data confidentiality and data integrity, and compared it with existing approaches. Our findings show that SafeMetaNet outperforms existing approaches, providing improved security. SafeMetaNet is a promising solution for secure data exchange in the IoT-Metaverse convergence. © 2023 ACM.",Blockchain; Data Exchange; Internet of Things; Metaverse; Security
Scopus,conferencePaper,2022,SoK: A Systematic Literature Review of Knowledge-Based Authentication on Augmented Reality Head-Mounted Displays,"ARES - International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security",B,"The adoption of Augmented Reality (AR) technology has increased over the years. AR enhances various activities for consumers and businesses, particularly in industrial contexts. The three-dimensional virtual experience is realized by the usage of Head-Mounted Displays (HMD). These devices provide access to sensitive data and services. Thus, secure and usable authentication schemes are essential to control access to the HMD and the stored data as well as schemes to authenticate to the services one wants to use with the AR device. We conducted a systematic literature review on knowledge-based authentication schemes for AR HMD. 31 different schemes were identified. These schemes were assessed regarding various aspects including the type of AR HMD, the type of secret, how users input their secret, as well as usability and security aspects. We discuss gaps for future work.  © 2022 Owner/Author.",Augmented Reality; Authentication; Head-Mounted Display; Literature Review; Password Entry
Scopus,conferencePaper,2015,Usability of augmented reality for revealing secret messages to users but not their devices,SOUPS - Symposium On Usable Privacy and Security,B,"We evaluate the possibility of a human receiving a secret message while trusting no device with the contents of that message, by using visual cryptography (VC) implemented with augmented-reality displays (ARDs). In a pilot user study using Google Glass and an improved study using the Epson Moverio, users were successfully able to decode VC messages using ARDs. In particular, 26 out of 30 participants in the Epson Moverio study decoded numbers and letters with 100% accuracy. Our studies also tested assumptions made in previous VC research about users' abilities to detect active modification of a ciphertext. While a majority of the participants could identify that the images were modified, fewer participants could detect all of the modifications in the ciphertext or the decoded plaintext. © 2015 by The USENIX Association.",
Scopus,conferencePaper,2015,Ethics emerging: The story of privacy and security perceptions in virtual reality,SOUPS - Symposium On Usable Privacy and Security,B,"Virtual reality (VR) technology aims to transport the user to a virtual world, fully immersing them in an experience entirely separate from the real world. VR devices can use sensor data to draw deeply personal inferences (e.g., medical conditions, emotions) and can enable virtual crimes (e.g., theft, assault on virtual representations of the user) from which users have been shown to experience real, significant emotional pain. As such, VR may involve especially sensitive user data and interactions. To effectively mitigate such risks and design for safer experiences, we aim to understand end-user perceptions of VR risks and how, if at all, developers are considering and addressing those risks. In this paper, we present the first work on VR security and privacy perceptions: a mixed-methods study involving semi-structured interviews with 20 VR users and developers, a survey of VR privacy policies, and an ethics co-design study with VR developers. We establish a foundational understanding of perceived risks in VR; raise concerns about the state of VR privacy policies; and contribute a concrete VR developer “code of ethics”, created by developers, for developers. © 2018 by The USENIX Association All Rights Reserved.",
Scopus,conferencePaper,2015,Evaluating and redefining smartphone permissions with contextualized justifications for mobile augmented reality apps,SOUPS - Symposium On Usable Privacy and Security,B,"Augmented reality (AR), and specifically mobile augmented reality (MAR) gained much public attention after the success of Pokémon Go in 2016, and since then has found application in online games, social media, entertainment, real estate, interior design, and other services. MAR apps are highly dependent on real time context-specific information provided by the different sensors and data processing capabilities of smartphones (e.g., LiDAR, gyroscope or object recognition). This dependency raises crucial privacy issues for end users. We evaluate whether the existing access permission systems, initially developed for non-AR apps, as well as proposed new permissions, relevant for MAR apps, provide sufficient and clear information to the users. We address this research goal in two online survey-based experiments with a total of 581 participants. Based on our results, we argue that it is necessary to increase transparency about MAR apps' data practices by requesting users' permissions to access certain novel and privacy invasive resources and functionalities commonly used in MAR apps, such as speech and face recognition. We also find that adding justifications, contextualized to the data collection practices of the app, improves transparency and can mitigate privacy concerns, at least in the context of data utilized to the users' benefit. Better understanding of the app's practices and lower concerns, in turn, increase the intentions to grant permissions. We provide recommendations for better transparency in MAR apps. © is held by the author/owner.

Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,Investigating Security Indicators for Hyperlinking Within the Metaverse,SOUPS - Symposium On Usable Privacy and Security,B,"Security indicators, such as the padlock icon indicating SSL encryption in browsers, are established mechanisms to convey secure connections. Currently, such indicators mainly exist for browsers and mobile environments. With the rise of the metaverse, we investigate how to mark secure transitions between applications in virtual reality to so-called sub-metaverses. For this, we first conducted in-depth interviews with domain experts (N=8) to understand the general design dimensions for security indicators in virtual reality (VR). Using these insights and considering additional design constraints, we implemented the five most promising indicators and evaluated them in a user study (N=25). While the visual blinking indicator placed in the periphery performed best regarding accuracy and task completion time, participants subjectively preferred the static visual indicator above the portal. Moreover, the latter received high scores regarding understandability while still being rated low regarding intrusiveness and disturbance. Our findings contribute to a more secure and enjoyable metaverse experience.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,"An Investigation of Teenager Experiences in Social Virtual Reality from Teenagers', Parents', and Bystanders' Perspectives",SOUPS - Symposium On Usable Privacy and Security,B,"The recent rise of social virtual reality (VR) platforms has introduced new technology characteristics and user experiences, which may lead to new forms of online harassment, particularly among teenagers (aged 13-17). In this paper, we took a multi-stakeholder approach and investigate teenagers' experiences and safety threats in social VR from three perspectives (teenagers, parents, and bystanders) to cover complementary perspectives. Through an interview study with 24 participants (8 teenagers, 7 parents, and 9 bystanders), we found several safety threats that teenagers may face, such as virtual grooming, ability-based discrimination, unforeseeable threats in privacy rooms, etc. We highlight new forms of harassment in the social VR context, such as erotic role-play and abuse through phantom sense, as well as the discrepancies among teenagers, parents, and bystanders regarding their perceptions of such threats. We draw design implications to better support safer social VR environments for teenagers.",
Scopus,conferencePaper,2021,Spectrum-flexible secure broadcast ranging,WiSec - Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks,B,"Secure ranging is poised to play a critical role in several emerging applications such as self-driving cars, unmanned aerial systems, wireless IoT devices, and augmented reality. In this paper, we propose a design of a secure broadcast ranging system with unique features and techniques. Its spectral-flexibility, and low-power short ranging bursts enable co-existence with existing systems such as in the 2.4GHz ISM band. We exploit a set of RF techniques such as upsampling and successive interference cancellation to achieve high accuracy and scalability to tens of reflectors even when operating over narrow bands of spectrum. We demonstrate that it can be implemented on popular SDR platforms FPGA and/or hosts (with minimal FPGA modifications). The protocol design, and cryptographically generated/detected signals, and randomized timing of transmissions, provide stealth and security against denial of service, sniffing, and distance manipulation attacks. Through extensive experimental evaluations (and simulations for scalability to over 100 reflectors) we demonstrate an accuracy below 20cm on a wide range of SNR (as low as 0dB), spectrum 25MHz-100MHz, with bursts as short as 5us. © 2021 ACM.",privacy; protocols; software defined radio; wireless ranging
