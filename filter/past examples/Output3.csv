Scopus,conferencePaper,2023,SigA: RPPG-Based Authentication for Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Display,"RAID - The International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions and Defenses",A,"Consumer-grade virtual reality head-mounted displays (VR-HMD) are becoming increasingly popular. Despite VR’s convenience and booming applications, VR-based authentication schemes are underdeveloped. The recently proposed authentication methods (Electrooculogram based, Electrical Muscle Stimulation-based, and alike) require active user involvement, disturbing many scenarios like drone flight and telemedicine. This paper proposes an effective and efficient user authentication method in VR environments resilient to impersonation attacks using physiological signals — Photoplethysmogram (PPG), namely SigA. SigA exploits the advantage that PPG is a physiological signal invisible to the naked eye. Using VR-HMDs to cover the eye area completely, SigA reduces the risk of signal leakage during PPG acquisition. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of SigA’s feasibility on five publicly available datasets, nine different pre-trained models, three facial regions, various lengths of the video clips required for training, four different signal time intervals, and continuous authentication with different sliding window sizes. The results demonstrate that SigA achieves more than 95% of the average F1-score in a one-second signal to accommodate a complete cardiac cycle for most adults, implying its applicability in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, experiments have shown that SigA is resistant to zero-effort attacks, statistical attacks, impersonation attacks (with a detection accuracy of over 95%) and session hijacking attacks.",Biometric Authentication; Head-mounted Display; Photoplethysmography; Physiological Signal; Virtual Reality
Scopus,conferencePaper,2023,Understanding Person Identification Through Gait,PETS - International Symposium on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,A,"Gait recognition is the process of identifying humans from their bipedal locomotion such as walking or running. As such, gait data is privacy sensitive information and should be anonymized where possible. With the rise of higher quality gait recording techniques, such as depth cameras or motion capture suits, an increasing amount of detailed gait data is captured and processed. The introduction and rise of the Metaverse is an example of a potentially popular application scenario in which the gait of users is transferred onto digital avatars. As a first step towards developing effective anonymization techniques for high-quality gait data, we study different aspects of movement data to quantify their contribution to gait recognition. We first extract categories of features from the literature on human gait perception and then design experiments for each category to assess how much the information they contain contributes to recognition success. We evaluated the utility of gait perturbation by means of naturalness ratings in a user study. Our results show that gait anonymization will be challenging, as the data is highly redundant and inter-dependent.",
Scopus,conferencePaper,2023,Exploring the Privacy Risks of Adversarial VR Game Design,PETS - International Symposium on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,A,"Fifty study participants playtested an innocent-looking “escape room” game in virtual reality (VR). Within just a few minutes, an adversarial program had accurately inferred over 25 of their personal data attributes, from anthropometrics like height and wingspan to demographics like age and gender. As notoriously data-hungry companies become increasingly involved in VR development, this experimental scenario may soon represent a typical VR user experience. Since the Cambridge Analytica scandal of 2018, adversarially-designed gamified elements have been known to constitute a significant privacy threat in conventional social platforms. In this work, we present a case study of how metaverse environments can similarly be adversarially constructed to covertly infer dozens of personal data attributes from seemingly-anonymous users. While existing VR privacy research largely focuses on passive observation, we argue that because individuals subconsciously reveal personal information via their motion in response to specific stimuli, active attacks pose an outsized risk in VR environments.",
Scopus,conferencePaper,2023,Speculative Privacy Concerns About AR Glasses Data Collection,PETS - International Symposium on Privacy Enhancing Technologies,A,"As technology companies develop mass market augmented reality (AR) glasses that are increasingly sensor-laden and affordable, uses of such devices pose potential privacy and security problems. Though prior work has broadly addressed some of these problems, our work specifically addresses the potential data collection of 15 data types by AR glasses and five potential data uses. Via semi-structured interviews, we explored the attitudes and concerns of 21 current AR technology users regarding potential data collection and data use by hypothetical consumer-grade AR glasses. Participants expressed diverse concerns and suggested potential limits to AR data collection and use, evoking privacy concepts and informational norms. We discuss how participants’ attitudes and reservations about data collection and use, like definitions of privacy, are varying and context-dependent, and make recommendations for designers and policy makers, including customizable and multidimensional privacy solutions.",
