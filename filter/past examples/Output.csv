ACM DL,conferencePaper,2014,World-Driven Access Control for Continuous Sensing,CCS - ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security,A*,"Modern applications increasingly rely on continuous monitoring of video, audio, or other sensor data to provide their functionality, particularly in platforms such as the Microsoft Kinect and Google Glass. Continuous sensing by untrusted applications poses significant privacy challenges for both device users and bystanders. Even honest users will struggle to manage application permissions using existing approaches.We propose a general, extensible framework for controlling access to sensor data on multi-application continuous sensing platforms. Our approach, world-driven access control, allows real-world objects to explicitly specify access policies. This approach relieves the user's permission management burden while mediating access at the granularity of objects rather than full sensor streams. A trusted policy module on the platform senses policies in the world and modifies applications' ""views"" accordingly. For example, world-driven access control allows the system to automatically stop recording in bathrooms or remove bystanders from video frames,without the user prompted to specify or activate such policies. To convey and authenticate policies, we introduce passports, a new kind of certificate that includes both a policy and optionally the code for recognizing a real-world object.We implement a prototype system and use it to study the feasibility of world-driven access control in practice. Our evaluation suggests that world-driven access control can effectively reduce the user's permission management burden in emerging continuous sensing systems. Our investigation also surfaces key challenges for future access control mechanisms for continuous sensing applications.",wearable; augmented reality; access control; permissions; continuous sensing
IEEE,conferencePaper,2015,SurroundWeb: Mitigating Privacy Concerns in a 3D Web Browser,SP - IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy,A*,"Immersive experiences that mix digital and real-world objects are becoming reality, but they raise serious privacy concerns as they require real-time sensor input. These experiences are already present on smartphones and game consoles via Kinect, and will eventually emerge on the web platform. However, browsers do not expose the display interfaces needed to render immersive experiences. Previous security research focuses on controlling application access to sensor input alone, and do not deal with display interfaces. Recent research in human computer interactions has explored a variety of high-level rendering interfaces for immersive experiences, but these interfaces reveal sensitive data to the application. Bringing immersive experiences to the web requires a high-level interface that mitigates privacy concerns. This paper presents Surround Web, the first 3D web browser, which provides the novel functionality of rendering web content onto a room while tackling many of the inherent privacy challenges. Following the principle of least privilege, we propose three abstractions for immersive rendering: 1) the room skeleton lets applications place content in response to the physical dimensions and locations of render able surfaces in a room, 2) the detection sandbox lets applications declaratively place content near recognized objects in the room without revealing if the object is present, and 3) satellite screens let applications display content across devices registered with Surround Web. Through user surveys, we validate that these abstractions limit the amount of revealed information to an acceptable degree. In addition, we show that a wide range of immersive experiences can be implemented with acceptable performance.",augmented reality;JavaScript;web browser;projection mapping
IEEE,conferencePaper,2016,"Prepose: Privacy, Security, and Reliability for Gesture-Based Programming",SP - IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy,A*,"With the rise of sensors such as the Microsoft Kinect, Leap Motion, and hand motion sensors in phones (i.e., Samsung Galaxy S6), gesture-based interfaces have become practical. Unfortunately, today, to recognize such gestures, applications must have access to depth and video of the user, exposing sensitive data about the user and her environment. Besides these privacy concerns, there are also security threats in sensor-based applications, such as multiple applications registering the same gesture, leading to a conflict (akin to Clickjacking on the web). We address these security and privacy threats with Prepose, a novel domain-specific language (DSL) for easily building gesture recognizers, combined with a system architecture that protects privacy, security, and reliability with untrusted applications. We run Prepose code in a trusted core, and only return specific gesture events to applications. Prepose is specifically designed to enable precise and sound static analysis using SMT solvers, allowing the system to check security and reliability properties before running a gesture recognizer. We demonstrate that Prepose is expressive by creating gestures in three representative domains: physical therapy, tai-chi, and ballet. We further show that runtime gesture matching in Prepose is fast, creating no noticeable lag, as measured on traces from Microsoft Kinect runs. To show that gesture checking at the time of submission to a gesture store is fast, we developed a total of four Z3-based static analyses to test for basic gesture safety and internal validity, to make sure the so-called protected gestures are not overridden, and to check inter-gesture conflicts. Our static analysis scales well in practice: safety checking is under 0.5 seconds per gesture, average validity checking time is only 188ms, lastly, for 97% of the cases, the conflict detection time is below 5 seconds, with only one query taking longer than 15 seconds.",augmented reality;domain-specific language;kinect;security;privacy
IEEE,conferencePaper,2017,Securing Augmented Reality Output,SP - IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy,A*,"Augmented reality (AR) technologies, such as Microsoft's HoloLens head-mounted display and AR-enabled car windshields, are rapidly emerging. AR applications provide users with immersive virtual experiences by capturing input from a user's surroundings and overlaying virtual output on the user's perception of the real world. These applications enable users to interact with and perceive virtual content in fundamentally new ways. However, the immersive nature of AR applications raises serious security and privacy concerns. Prior work has focused primarily on input privacy risks stemming from applications with unrestricted access to sensor data. However, the risks associated with malicious or buggy AR output remain largely unexplored. For example, an AR windshield application could intentionally or accidentally obscure oncoming vehicles or safety-critical output of other AR applications. In this work, we address the fundamental challenge of securing AR output in the face of malicious or buggy applications. We design, prototype, and evaluate Arya, an AR platform that controls application output according to policies specified in a constrained yet expressive policy framework. In doing so, we identify and overcome numerous challenges in securing AR output.",security;augmented reality
IEEE,conferencePaper,2018,Towards Security and Privacy for Multi-user Augmented Reality: Foundations with End Users,SP - IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy,A*,"Immersive augmented reality (AR) technologies are becoming a reality. Prior works have identified security and privacy risks raised by these technologies, primarily considering individual users or AR devices. However, we make two key observations: (1) users will not always use AR in isolation, but also in ecosystems of other users, and (2) since immersive AR devices have only recently become available, the risks of AR have been largely hypothetical to date. To provide a foundation for understanding and addressing the security and privacy challenges of emerging AR technologies, grounded in the experiences of real users, we conduct a qualitative lab study with an immersive AR headset, the Microsoft HoloLens. We conduct our study in pairs - 22 participants across 11 pairs - wherein participants engage in paired and individual (but physically co-located) HoloLens activities. Through semi-structured interviews, we explore participants' security, privacy, and other concerns, raising key findings. For example, we find that despite the HoloLens's limitations, participants were easily immersed, treating virtual objects as real (e.g., stepping around them for fear of tripping). We also uncover numerous security, privacy, and safety concerns unique to AR (e.g., deceptive virtual objects misleading users about the real world), and a need for access control among users to manage shared physical spaces and virtual content embedded in those spaces. Our findings give us the opportunity to identify broader lessons and key challenges to inform the design of emerging single-and multi-user AR technologies.",augmented reality;multi user interaction;privacy;security;user studies
IEEE,conferencePaper,2022,SoK: Authentication in Augmented and Virtual Reality,SP - IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy,A*,"Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) devices are emerging as prominent contenders to todayâ€™s personal computers. As personal devices, users will use AR and VR to store and access their sensitive data and thus will need secure and usable ways to authenticate. In this paper, we evaluate the state-of-the-art of authentication mechanisms for AR/VR devices by systematizing research efforts and practical deployments. By studying usersâ€™ experiences with authentication on AR and VR, we gain insight into the important properties needed for authentication on these devices. We then use these properties to perform a comprehensive evaluation of AR/VR authentication mechanisms both proposed in literature and used in practice. In all, we synthesize a coherent picture of the current state of authentication mechanisms for AR/VR devices. We draw on our findings to provide concrete research directions and advice on implementing and evaluating future authentication methods.",
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Privacy Leakage via Unrestricted Motion-Position Sensors in the Age of Virtual Reality: A Study of Snooping Typed Input on Virtual Keyboards,SP - IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy,A*,"Virtual Reality (VR) has gained popularity in numerous fields, including gaming, social interactions, shopping, and education. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study to assess the trustworthiness of the embedded sensors on VR, which embed various forms of sensitive data that may put usersâ€™ privacy at risk. We find that accessing most on-board sensors (e.g., motion, position, and button sensors) on VR SDKs/APIs, such as OpenVR, Oculus Platform, and WebXR, requires no security permission, exposing a huge attack surface for an adversary to steal the userâ€™s privacy. We validate this vulnerability through developing malware programs and malicious websites and specifically explore to what extent it exposes the userâ€™s information in the context of keystroke snooping. To examine its actual threat in practice, the adversary in the considered attack model doesnâ€™t possess any labeled data from the user nor knowledge about the userâ€™s VR settings. Extensive experiments, involving two mainstream VR systems and four keyboards with different typing mechanisms, demonstrate that our proof-of-concept attack can recognize the userâ€™s virtual typing with over 89.7% accuracy. The attack can recover the userâ€™s passwords with up to 84.9% recognition accuracy if three attempts are allowed and achieve an average of 87.1% word recognition rate for paragraph inference. We hope this study will help the community gain awareness of the vulnerability in the sensor management of current VR systems and provide insights to facilitate the future design of more comprehensive and restricted sensor access control mechanisms.",keystroke-inference;virtual-reality;cybersecurity
IEEE,conferencePaper,2023,Low-effort VR Headset User Authentication Using Head-reverberated Sounds with Replay Resistance,SP - IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy,A*,"While Virtual Reality (VR) applications are becoming increasingly common, efficiently verifying a VR device user before granting personal access is still a challenge. Existing VR authentication methods require users to enter PINs or draw graphical passwords using controllers. Though the entry is in the virtual space, it can be observed by others in proximity and is subject to critical security issues. Furthermore, the in-air hand movements or handheld controller-based authentications require active user participation and are not time-efficient. This work proposes a low-effort VR device authentication system based on the unique skull-reverberated sounds, which can be acquired when the user wears the VR device. Specifically, when the user puts on the VR device or is wearing it to log into an online account, the proposed system actively emits an ultrasonic signal to initiate the authentication session. The signal returning to the VR deviceâ€™s microphone has been reverberated by the userâ€™s head, which is unique in size, skull shape and mass. We thus extract head biometric information from the received signal for unobtrusive VR device authentication.Though active acoustic sensing has been broadly used on mobile devices, no prior work has ever successfully applied such techniques to commodity VR devices. Because VR devices are designed to provide users with virtual reality immersion, the echo sounds used for active sensing are unwanted and severely suppressed. The raw audio before this process is also not accessible without kernel/hardware modifications. Thus, our work further solves the challenge of active acoustic sensing under echo cancellation to enable deploying our system on off-the-shelf VR devices. Additionally, we show that the echo cancellation mechanism is naturally good to prevent acoustic replay attacks. The proposed system is developed based on an autoencoder and a convolutional neural network for biometric data extraction and recognition. Experiments with a standalone and a mobile phone VR headset show that our system efficiently verifies a user and is also replay-resistant.",Virtual Reality;Authentication;Biometric
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2020,OcuLock: Exploring Human Visual System for Authentication in Virtual Reality Head-mounted Display,NDSS - Usenix Network and Distributed System Security Symposium,A*,"The increasing popularity of virtual reality (VR) in a wide spectrum of applications has generated sensitive personal data such as medical records and credit card information. While protecting such data from unauthorized access is critical, directly applying traditional authentication methods (e.g., PIN) through new VR input modalities such as remote controllers and head navigation would cause security issues. The authentication action can be purposefully observed by attackers to infer the authentication input. Unlike any other mobile devices, VR presents immersive experience via a head-mounted display (HMD) that fully covers users' eye area without public exposure. Leveraging this feature, we explore human visual system (HVS) as a novel biometric authentication tailored for VR platforms. While previous works used eye globe movement (gaze) to authenticate smartphones or PCs, they suffer from a high error rate and low stability since eye gaze is highly dependent on cognitive states. In this paper, we explore the HVS as a whole to consider not just the eye globe movement but also the eyelid, extraocular muscles, cells, and surrounding nerves in the HVS. Exploring HVS biostructure and unique HVS features triggered by immersive VR content can enhance authentication stability. To this end, we present OcuLock, an HVS-based system for reliable and unobservable VR HMD authentication. OcuLock is empowered by an electrooculography (EOG) based HVS sensing framework and a record-comparison driven authentication scheme. Experiments through 70 subjects show that OcuLock is resistant against common types of attacks such as impersonation attack and statistical attack with Equal Error Rates as low as 3.55% and 4.97% respectively. More importantly, OcuLock maintains a stable performance over a 2-month period and is preferred by users when compared to other potential approaches.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,SoundLock: A Novel User Authentication Scheme for VR Devices Using Auditory-Pupillary Response,NDSS - Usenix Network and Distributed System Security Symposium,A*,"Virtual Reality (VR) has shown promising potential in many applications, such as e-business, healthcare, and social networking. Rich information regarding users’ activities and online accounts is stored in VR devices. If they are carelessly unattended, adversarial access will cause data breaches and other critical consequences. Practical user authentication schemes for VR devices are in dire need. Current solutions, including passwords, digital PINs, and pattern locks, mostly follow conventional approaches for general personal devices. They have been criticized for deficits in both security and usability. In this work, we propose SoundLock, a novel user authentication scheme for VR devices using auditory-pupillary response as biometrics. During authentication, auditory stimuli are presented to the user via the VR headset. The corresponding pupillary response is captured by the integrated eye tracker. User’s legitimacy is then determined by comparing the response with the template generated during the enrollment stage. To strike a balance between security and usability in the scheme design, an optimization problem is formulated. Due to its nonlinearity, a two-stage heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve it efficiently. The solution provides necessary guidance for selecting effective auditory stimuli and determining their corresponding lengths. We demonstrate through extensive in-field experiments that SoundLock outperforms state-of-the-art biometric solutions with FAR (FRR) as low as 0.76%(0.91%) and is well received among participants in the user study.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2022,Lumos: Identifying and Localizing Diverse Hidden IoT Devices in an Unfamiliar Environment,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Hidden IoT devices are increasingly being used to snoop on users in hotel rooms or AirBnBs. We envision empowering users entering such unfamiliar environments to identify and locate (e.g., hidden camera behind plants) diverse hidden devices (e.g., cameras, microphones, speakers) using only their personal handhelds. What makes this challenging is the limited network visibility and physical access that a user has in such unfamiliar environments, coupled with the lack of specialized equipment. This paper presents Lumos, a system that runs on commodity user devices (e.g., phone, laptop) and enables users to identify and locate WiFi-connected hidden IoT devices and visualize their presence using an augmented reality interface. Lumos addresses key challenges in: (1) identifying diverse devices using only coarse-grained wireless layer features, without IP/DNS layer information and without knowledge of the WiFi channel assignments of the hidden devices; and (2) locating the identified IoT devices with respect to the user using only phone sensors and wireless signal strength measurements. We evaluated Lumos across 44 different IoT devices spanning various types, models, and brands across six different environments. Our results show that Lumos can identify hidden devices with 95% accuracy and locate them with a median error of 1.5m within 30 minutes in a two-bedroom, 1000 sq. ft. apartment.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2022,OVRSEEN: Auditing Network Traffic and Privacy Policies in Oculus VR,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Virtual reality (VR) is an emerging technology that enables new applications but also introduces privacy risks. In this paper, we focus on Oculus VR (OVR), the leading platform in the VR space and we provide the first comprehensive analysis of personal data exposed by OVR apps and the platform itself, from a combined networking and privacy policy perspective. We experimented with the Quest 2 headset and tested the most popular VR apps available on the official Oculus and the SideQuest app stores. We developed OVRSEEN, a methodology and system for collecting, analyzing, and comparing network traffic and privacy policies on OVR. On the networking side, we captured and decrypted network traffic of VR apps, which was previously not possible on OVR, and we extracted data flows, defined as < app, data type, destination >. Compared to the mobile and other app ecosystems, we found OVR to be more centralized and driven by tracking and analytics, rather than by third-party advertising. We show that the data types exposed by VR apps include personally identifiable information (PII), device information that can be used for fingerprinting, and VR-specific data types. By comparing the data flows found in the network traffic with statements made in the apps' privacy policies, we found that approximately 70% of OVR data flows were not properly disclosed. Furthermore, we extracted additional context from the privacy policies, and we observed that 69% of the data flows were used for purposes unrelated to the core functionality of apps.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2021,Kal epsilon ido: Real-Time Privacy Control for Eye-Tracking Systems,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Recent advances in sensing and computing technologies have led to the rise of eye-tracking platforms. Ranging from mobiles to high-end mixed reality headsets, a wide spectrum of interactive systems now employs eye-tracking. However, eye gaze data is a rich source of sensitive information that can reveal an individual's physiological and psychological traits. Prior approaches to protecting eye-tracking data suffer from two major drawbacks: they are either incompatible with the current eye-tracking ecosystem or provide no formal privacy guarantee. In this paper, we propose Kal epsilon ido, an eyetracking data processing system that (1) provides a formal privacy guarantee, (2) integrates seamlessly with existing eyetracking ecosystems, and (3) operates in real-time. Kal epsilon ido acts as an intermediary protection layer in the software stack of eye-tracking systems. We conduct a comprehensive user study and trace-based analysis to evaluate Kal epsilon ido. Our user study shows that the users enjoy a satisfactory level of utility from Kal epsilon ido. Additionally, we present empirical evidence of Kal epsilon ido's effectiveness in thwarting real-world attacks on eye-tracking data.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2021,AdCube: WebVR Ad Fraud and Practical Confinement of Third-Party Ads,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Web technology has evolved to offer 360-degree immersive browsing experiences. This new technology, called WebVR, enables virtual reality by rendering a three-dimensional world on an HTML canvas. Unfortunately, there exists no browser-supported way of sharing this canvas between different parties. Assuming an abusive ad service provider who exploits this absence, we present four new ad fraud attack methods. Our user study demonstrates that the success rates of our attacks range from 88.23% to 100%, confirming their effectiveness. To mitigate the presented threats, we propose AdCube, which allows publishers to specify the behaviors of third-party ad code and enforce this specification. We show that AdCube is able to block the presented threats with a small page loading latency of 236 msec and a negligible frame-per-second (FPS) drop for nine WebVR official demo sites.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2019,Secure Multi-User Content Sharing for Augmented Reality Applications,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Augmented reality (AR), which overlays virtual content on top of the user's perception of the real world, has now begun to enter the consumer market. Besides smartphone platforms, early-stage head-mounted displays such as the Microsoft HoloLens are under active development. Many compelling uses of these technologies are multi-user: e.g., inperson collaborative tools, multiplayer gaming, and telepresence. While prior work on AR security and privacy has studied potential risks from AR applications, new risks will also arise among multiple human users. In this work, we explore the challenges that arise in designing secure and private content sharing for multi-user AR. We analyze representative application case studies and systematize design goals for security and functionality that a multi-user AR platform should support. We design an AR content sharing control module that achieves these goals and build a prototype implementation (ShareAR) for the HoloLens. This work builds foundations for secure and private multi-user AR interactions.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2016,Virtual U: Defeating Face Liveness Detection by Building Virtual Models From Your Public Photos,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to bypass modern face authentication systems. More specifically, by leveraging a handful of pictures of the target user taken from social media, we show how to create realistic, textured, 3D facial models that undermine the security of widely used face authentication solutions. Our framework makes use of virtual reality (VR) systems, incorporating along the way the ability to perform animations (e.g., raising an eyebrow or smiling) of the facial model, in order to trick liveness detectors into believing that the 3D model is a real human face. The synthetic face of the user is displayed on the screen of the VR device, and as the device rotates and translates in the real world, the 3D face moves accordingly. To an observing face authentication system, the depth and motion cues of the display match what would be expected for a human face. We argue that such VR-based spoofing attacks constitute a fundamentally new class of attacks that point to a serious weaknesses in camera-based authentication systems: Unless they incorporate other sources of verifiable data, systems relying on color image data and camera motion are prone to attacks via virtual realism. To demonstrate the practical nature of this threat, we conduct thorough experiments using an end-to-end implementation of our approach and show how it undermines the security of several face authentication solutions that include both motion-based and liveness detectors.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2013,Enabling Fine-Grained Permissions for Augmented Reality Applications with Recognizers,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Augmented reality (AR) applications sense the environment, then render virtual objects on human senses. Examples include smartphone applications that annotate storefronts with reviews and XBox Kinect games that show"" avatars"" mimicking human movements. No current OS has special support for such applications. As a result, permissions for AR applications are necessarily coarse-grained: applications must ask for access to raw sensor feeds, such as video and audio. These raw feeds expose significant additional information beyond what applications need, including sensitive information such as the user’s location, face, or surroundings.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,Exploring User Reactions and Mental Models Towards Perceptual Manipulation Attacks in Mixed Reality,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Perceptual Manipulation Attacks (PMA) involve manipulating users’ multi-sensory (e.g., visual, auditory, haptic) perceptions of the world through Mixed Reality (MR) content, in order to influence users’ judgments and following actions. For example, a MR driving application that is expected to show safety-critical output might also (maliciously or unintentionally) overlay the wrong signal on a traffic sign, misleading the user into slamming on the brake. While current MR technology is sufficient to create such attacks, little research has been done to understand how users perceive, react to, and defend against such potential manipulations. To provide a foundation for understanding and addressing PMA in MR, we conducted an in-person study with 21 participants. We developed three PMA in which we focused on attacking three different perceptions: visual, auditory, and situational awareness. Our study first investigates how user reactions are affected by evaluating their performance on “microbenchmark” tasks under benchmark and different attack conditions. We observe both primary and secondary impacts from attacks, later impacting participants’ performance even under non-attack conditions. We follow up with interviews, surfacing a range of user reactions and interpretations of PMA. Through qualitative data analysis of our observations and interviews, we identify various defensive strategies participants developed, and we observe how these strategies sometimes backfire. We derive recommendations for future investigation and defensive directions based on our findings.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,LocIn: Inferring Semantic Location from Spatial Maps in Mixed Reality,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Mixed reality (MR) devices capture 3D spatial maps of users' surroundings to integrate virtual content into their physical environment. Existing permission models implemented in popular MR platforms allow all MR apps to access these 3D spatial maps without explicit permission. Unmonitored access of MR apps to these 3D spatial maps poses serious privacy threats to users as these maps capture detailed geometric and semantic characteristics of users' environments. In this paper, we present LocIn, a new location inference attack that exploits these detailed characteristics embedded in 3D spatial maps to infer a user's indoor location type. LocIn develops a multi-task approach to train an end-to-end encoder-decoder network that extracts a spatial feature representation for capturing contextual patterns of the user's environment. LocIn leverages this representation to detect 3D objects and surfaces and integrates them into a classification network with a novel unified optimization function to predict the user's indoor location. We demonstrate LocIn attack on spatial maps collected from three popular MR devices. We show that LocIn infers a user's location type with an average 84.1% accuracy.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,"Hidden Reality: Caution, Your Hand Gesture Inputs in the Immersive Virtual World are Visible to All!",USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Text entry is an inevitable task while using Virtual Reality (VR) devices in a wide range of applications such as remote learning, gaming, and virtual meeting. VR users enter passwords/pins to log in to their user accounts in various applications and type regular text to compose emails or browse the internet. The typing activity on VR devices is believed to be resistant to direct observation attacks as the virtual screen in an immersive environment is not directly visible to others present in physical proximity. This paper presents a video-based side-channel attack, Hidden Reality (HR), that shows – although the virtual screen in VR devices is not in direct sight of adversaries, the indirect observations might get exploited to steal the user’s private information. The Hidden Reality (HR) attack utilizes video clips of the user’s hand gestures while they type on the virtual screen to decipher the typed text in various key entry scenarios on VR devices including typed pins and passwords. Experimental analysis performed on a large corpus of 368 video clips show that the Hidden Reality model can successfully decipher an average of over 75% of the text inputs. The high success rate of our attack model led us to conduct a user study to understand the user’s behavior and perception of security in virtual reality. The analysis showed that over 95% of users were not aware of any security threats on VR devices and believed the immersive environments to be secure from digital attacks. Our attack model challenges users’ false sense of security in immersive environments and emphasizes the need for more stringent security solutions in VR space.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,Erebus: Access Control for Augmented Reality Systems,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Augmented Reality (AR) is widely considered the next evolution in personal devices, enabling seamless integration of the digital world into our reality. Such integration, however, often requires unfettered access to sensor data, causing significant overprivilege for applications that run on these platforms. Through analysis of 17 AR systems and 45 popular AR applications, we explore existing mechanisms for access control in AR platforms, identify key trends in how AR applications use sensor data, and pinpoint unique threats users face in AR environments. Using these findings, we design and implement Erebus, an access control framework for AR platforms that enables fine-grained control over data used by AR applications. Erebus achieves the principle of least privileged through creation of a domain-specific language (DSL) for permission control in AR platforms, allowing applications to specify data needed for their functionality. Using this DSL, Erebus further enables users to customize app permissions to apply under specific user conditions. We implement Erebus on Google's ARCore SDK and port five existing AR applications to demonstrate Erebus capability to secure various classes of apps. Performance results using these applications and various microbenchmarks show that Erebus achieves its security goals while being practical, introducing negligible performance overhead to the AR system.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,"Unique Identification of 50, 000+ Virtual Reality Users from Head & Hand Motion Data",USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"With the recent explosive growth of interest and investment in virtual reality (VR) and the so-called ""metaverse,"" public attention has rightly shifted toward the unique security and privacy threats that these platforms may pose. While it has long been known that people reveal information about themselves via their motion, the extent to which this makes an individual globally identifiable within virtual reality has not yet been widely understood. In this study, we show that a large number of real VR users (N=55,541) can be uniquely and reliably identified across multiple sessions using just their head and hand motion relative to virtual objects. After training a classification model on 5 minutes of data per person, a user can be uniquely identified amongst the entire pool of 50,000+ with 94.33% accuracy from 100 seconds of motion, and with 73.20% accuracy from just 10 seconds of motion. This work is the first to truly demonstrate the extent to which biomechanics may serve as a unique identifier in VR, on par with widely used biometrics such as facial or fingerprint recognition.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,Going through the motions: AR/VR keylogging from user head motions,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) are the next step in the evolution of ubiquitous computing after personal computers to mobile devices. Applications of AR/VR continue to grow, including education and virtual workspaces, increasing opportunities for users to enter private text, such as passwords or sensitive corporate information. In this work, we show that there is a serious security risk of typed text in the foreground being inferred by a background application, without requiring any special permissions. The key insight is that a user’s head moves in subtle ways as she types on a virtual keyboard, and these motion signals are sufficient for inferring the text that a user types. We develop a system, TyPose, that extracts these signals and automatically infers words or characters that a victim is typing. Once the sensor signals are collected, TyPose uses machine learning to segment the motion signals in time to determine word/character boundaries, and also perform inference on the words/characters themselves. Our experimental evaluation on commercial AR/VR headsets demonstrate the feasibility of this attack, both in situations where multiple users’ data is used for training (82% top-5 word classification accuracy) or when the attack is personalized to a particular victim (92% top-5 word classification accuracy). We also show that first-line defenses of reducing the sampling rate or precision of head tracking are ineffective, suggesting that more sophisticated mitigations are needed.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,Is Your Wallet Snitching On You? An Analysis on the Privacy Implications of Web3,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"With the recent hype around the Metaverse and NFTs, Web3 is getting more and more popular. The goal of Web3 is to decentralize the web via decentralized applications. Wallets play a crucial role as they act as an interface between these applications and the user. Wallets such as MetaMask are being used by millions of users nowadays. Unfortunately, Web3 is often advertised as more secure and private. However, decentralized applications as well as wallets are based on traditional technologies, which are not designed with privacy of users in mind. In this paper, we analyze the privacy implications that Web3 technologies such as decentralized applications and wallets have on users. To this end, we build a framework that measures exposure of wallet information. First, we study whether information about installed wallets is being used to track users online. We analyze the top 100K websites and find evidence of 1,325 websites running scripts that probe whether users have wallets installed in their browser. Second, we measure whether decentralized applications and wallets leak the user's unique wallet address to third-parties. We intercept the traffic of 616 decentralized applications and 100 wallets and find over 2000 leaks across 211 applications and more than 300 leaks across 13 wallets. Our study shows that Web3 poses a threat to users' privacy and requires new designs towards more privacy-aware wallet architectures.",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,It's all in your head(set): Side-channel attacks on AR/VR systems,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"With the increasing adoption of Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) systems, security and privacy concerns at tract attention from both academia and industry. This paper demonstrates that AR/VR systems are vulnerable to side channel attacks launched from software; a malicious appli cation without any special permissions can infer private in formation about user interactions, other concurrent applica tions, or even the surrounding world. We develop a number of side-channel attacks targeting different types of private information. Specifically, we demonstrate three attacks on the victim’s interactions, successfully recovering hand gestures, voice commands made by victims, and keystrokes on a virtual keyboard, with accuracy exceeding 90%. We also demon strate an application fingerprinting attack where the spy is able to identify an application being launched by the victim.

Web of Science,conferencePaper,2023,A Peek into the Metaverse: Detecting 3D Model Clones in Mobile Games,USS - Usenix Security Symposium,A*,"3D models are indispensable assets in metaverse in general and mobile games in particular. Yet, these 3D models can be readily extracted, duplicated, or cloned, a reality that poses a considerable threat. Although instances of games duplicating 3D models from other games have been documented, the pervasiveness of this issue remains unexplored. In this paper, we undertake the first systematic investigation of 3D model cloning within mobile games. However, multiple challenges have to be addressed for clone detection, including scalability, precision, and robustness. Our solution is 3DSCAN, an open source 3D Scanning tool for Clone Assessment and Notification. We have evaluated 3DSCAN with about 12.2 million static 3D models and 2.5 million animated 3D models extracted from 176K mobile games. With these 3D models, 3DSCAN determined that 63.03% of the static models are likely cloned ones (derived from 1,046,632 distinct models), and 37.07% animated 3D models are likely cloned ones (derived from 180,174 distinctive models). With a heuristic-based clone detection algorithm, 3DSCAN finally detected 5,238 mobile games likely containing unauthorized 3D model clones.",

Web of Science,conferencePaper,2017,HoloPair: Securing Shared Augmented Reality Using Microsoft HoloLens,ACSAC - Annual Computer Security Applications Conference,A,"Augmented Reality (AR) devices continuously scan their environment in order to naturally overlay virtual objects onto user's view of the physical world. In contrast to Virtual Reality, where one's environment is fully replaced with a virtual one, one of AR's killer features is co-located collaboration, in which multiple users interact with the same combination of virtual and real objects. Microsoft recently released HoloLens, the first consumer-ready augmented reality headset that needs no outside markers to achieve precise inside-out spatial mapping, which allows centimeter-scale hologram positioning. However, despite many applications published on the Windows Mixed Reality platform that rely on direct communication between AR devices, there currently exists no implementation or achievable proposal for secure direct pairing of two unassociated headsets. As augmented reality gets into mainstream, this omission exposes current and future users to a range of avoidable attacks. In order to close this real-world gap in both theory and engineering practice, in this paper we design and evaluate HoloPair, a system for secure and usable pairing of two AR headsets. We propose a pairing protocol and build a working prototype to experimentally evaluate its security guarantees, usability, and system performance. By running a user study with a total of 22 participants, we show that the system achieves high rates of attack detection, short pairing times, and a high average usability score. Moreover, in order to make an immediate impact on the wider developer community, we have published the full implementation and source code of our prototype, which is currently under consideration to be included in the official HoloLens development toolkit.",

Subsequently, we have become familiar with the sensing power of these applications and devices, and we are only starting to realize the nascent risks that these technology puts over our privacy and security. Current privacy protection measures are primarily aimed towards known and well-utilised data types (i.e. location, on-line activity, biometric, and so on) while a few works have focused on looking into the security and privacy risks of and providing protection on MR data, particularly on 3D MR data. In this work, we primarily reveal the privacy leakage from released 3D MR data and how the leakage persist even after implementing spatial generalizations and abstractions. Firstly, we formalize the spatial privacy problem in 3D mixed reality data as well as the adversary model. Then, we demonstrate through an inference model how adversaries can identify 3D spaces and, potentially, infer more spatial information. Moreover, we also demonstrate how compact 3D MR Data can be in terms of memory usage which allows adversaries to create lightweight 3D inference models of user spaces.",Mixed and augmented reality; 3D data; Point cloud data; Security and privacy

Two simple PIN-based authentication techniques are presented, both of which provide protection against shoulder surfing. The techniques employ two interfaces for entering the PIN, namely, voice (Voice-based PIN) and touchpad (Touch-based PIN). To enter the same PIN, user has the freedom to choose either technique and thereby interface, as per the environment in which authentication is being performed. A user study was conducted with 30 participants to compare the performance of the proposed methods with the built-in technique. The results show that the proposed mechanisms have a significantly better login success rate than the built-in technique. Interestingly, although the average authentication times of the proposed methods are higher than that of the built-in one, the users perceived them as being faster. The results also indicate that the proposed methods have better perceived security and usability than the built-in method. The study reveals that when it comes to authentication on augmented reality devices, there is a need for authentication mechanisms that complement each other as users tend to prefer a different interface in different contexts.",Google Glass; PIN; Authentication; Security; Usability
Web of Science,journalPaper,2019,GaitLock: Protect Virtual and Augmented Reality Headsets Using Gait,TODSC -Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,A,"With the fast penetration of commercial Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) systems into our daily life, the security issues of those devices have attracted significant interests from both academia and industry. Modern VR/AR systems typically use head-mounted devices (i.e., headsets) to interact with users, and often store private user data, e.g., social network accounts, online transactions or even payment information. This poses significant security threats, since in practice the headset can be potentially obtained and accessed by unauthenticated parties, e.g., identity thieves, and thus cause catastrophic breach. In this paper, we propose a novel GaitLock system, which can reliably authenticate users using their gait signatures. Our system doesn't require extra hardware, e.g., fingerprint sensors or retina scanners, but only uses the on-board inertial measurement units (IMUs) equipped in almost all mainstream VR/AR headsets to authenticate the legitimate users from intruders, by simply asking them to walk a few steps. To achieve that, we propose a new gait recognition model Dynamic-SRC, which combines the strength of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Sparse Representation Classifier (SRC), to extract unique gait patterns from the inertial signals during walking. We implement GaitLock on Google Glass (a typical AR headset), and extensive experiments show that GaitLock outperforms the state-of-the-art systems significantly in recognition accuracy (> 98 percent success in 5 steps), and is able to run in-situ on the resource-constrained VR/AR headsets without incurring high energy cost.",Gait recognition; VR/AR; sparse representation classification; dynamic time warping

Ensuring user safety in VRLE application domains such as education, flight simulations, military training is of utmost importance. Specifically, there is a need to study the impact of immersion attacks (e.g., chaperone attack, occlusion) and other types of attacks/faults (e.g., unauthorized access, network congestion) that may cause user safety issues (i.e., inducing of cybersickness). In this article, we present a novel framework to quantify the security, privacy issues triggered via immersion attacks and other types of attacks/faults. By using a real-world social VRLE viz., vSocial and creating a novel attack-fault tree model, we show that such attacks can induce undesirable levels of cybersickness. Next, we convert these attack-fault trees into stochastic timed automata (STA) representations to perform statistical model checking for a given attacker profile. Using this model checking approach, we determine the most vulnerable threat scenarios that can trigger high occurrence cases of cybersickness for VRLE users.

In this paper, we propose a method to distinguish between computer generated and natural faces by modeling and evaluating their dynamic behavior.

In this paper, we focus on this challenge and design three practical anti-eavesdropping password entry schemes on stand-alone smart glasses, named gTapper, gRotator and gTalker. The main idea is to break the correlation between the underlying password and the interaction observable to adversaries. In our IRB-approved user study, these schemes are found to be easy-to-use without additional hardware under various test conditions, where the participants can enter their passwords within moderate time, at high accuracy, and in various situations.",Password; Smart glasses; Eavesdropping; Usability; Glass; Authentication; Password entry; anti-eavesdropping; smart glasses; head-mounted device; usability and security

To build a secure living habitat, it's vital to ensure the virtual-physical traceability that tracking a malicious player in the physical world via his avatars in virtual space. In this paper, we propose a two-factor authentication framework based on biometric-based authentication and chameleon signature. First, aiming at disguise in virtual space, we design an avatar's two-factor identity model to ensure the verifiability of avatar's virtual identity and physical identity. Second, facing at authentication efficiency and keys holding cost, we propose a chameleon collision signature algorithm to efficiently ensure that the avatar's virtual identity is associated with its physical identity. Finally, aiming at impersonation in the physical world, we design two decentralized authentication protocols based on the avatar's identity model and the chameleon collision signature to achieve real-time authentication on the avatar's identity. Security analysis indicates that the proposed authentication framework guarantees the consistency and traceability of the avatar's identity.

Web of Science,journalPaper,2020,Mimicry Attacks on Smartphone Keystroke Authentication,TOPS - Transactions on Privacy and Security,A,"Keystroke behaviour-based authentication employs the unique typing behaviour of users to authenticate them. Recent such proposals for virtual keyboards on smartphones employ diverse temporal, contact, and spatial features to achieve over 95% accuracy. Consequently, they have been suggested as a second line of defense with text-based password authentication. We show that a state-of-the-art keystroke behaviour-based authentication scheme is highly vulnerable against mimicry attacks. While previous research used training interfaces to attack physical keyboards, we show that this approach has limited effectiveness against virtual keyboards. This is mainly due to the large number of diverse features that the attacker needs to mimic for virtual keyboards. We address this challenge by developing an augmented reality-based app that resides on the attacker's smartphone and leverages computer vision and keystroke data to provide real-time guidance during password entry on the victim's phone. In addition, we propose an audiovisual attack in which the attacker overlays transparent film printed with spatial pointers on the victim's device and uses audio cues to match the temporal behaviour of the victim. Both attacks require neither tampering or installing software on the victim's device nor specialized hardware. We conduct experiments with 30 users to mount over 400 mimicry attacks. We show that our methods enable an attacker to mimic keystroke behaviour on virtual keyboards with little effort. We also demonstrate the extensibility of our augmented reality-based technique by successfully mounting mimicry attacks on a swiping behaviour-based continuous authentication system.",Mimicry attacks; authentication; behavioural biometrics; spoofing attacks; augmented reality

In this article, we present the privacy risks associated with the hidden operations threat and propose a framework for application development and runtime permissions targeted specifically at preventing the execution of hidden operations.

Despite VR’s convenience and booming applications, VR-based authentication schemes are underdeveloped. The recently proposed authentication methods (Electrooculogram based, Electrical Muscle Stimulation-based, and alike) require active user involvement, disturbing many scenarios like drone flight and telemedicine. This paper proposes an effective and efficient user authentication method in VR environments resilient to impersonation attacks using physiological signals — Photoplethysmogram (PPG), namely SigA. SigA exploits the advantage that PPG is a physiological signal invisible to the naked eye. Using VR-HMDs to cover the eye area completely, SigA reduces the risk of signal leakage during PPG acquisition. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of SigA’s feasibility on five publicly available datasets, nine different pre-trained models, three facial regions, various lengths of the video clips required for training, four different signal time intervals, and continuous authentication with different sliding window sizes. The results demonstrate that SigA achieves more than 95% of the average F1-score in a one-second signal to accommodate a complete cardiac cycle for most adults, implying its applicability in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, experiments have shown that SigA is resistant to zero-effort attacks, statistical attacks, impersonation attacks (with a detection accuracy of over 95%) and session hijacking attacks.",Biometric Authentication; Head-mounted Display; Photoplethysmography; Physiological Signal; Virtual Reality

The introduction and rise of the Metaverse is an example of a potentially popular application scenario in which the gait of users is transferred onto digital avatars. As a first step towards developing effective anonymization techniques for high-quality gait data, we study different aspects of movement data to quantify their contribution to gait recognition. We first extract categories of features from the literature on human gait perception and then design experiments for each category to assess how much the information they contain contributes to recognition success. We evaluated the utility of gait perturbation by means of naturalness ratings in a user study.

""Cyber security challenge (CSC)"" events provide the means to collect datasets. The New Zealand National cyber security challenge event is designed to promote cyber security education, awareness and equally as important, collect datasets for research purposes. In this paper, we present the: (1) Importance of cyber security challenge events, (2) Highlight the importance of collecting datasets, and (3) present a user-centric security visualization model of attack behaviors. User-centric features with the theoretical concept of Data Provenance as a Security Visualization Service (DPaaSVS) reused to display attacks commencing at the reconnaissance stage through to compromising a defending team machine and exploiting the systems. DPaaSVS creates the ability for users to interact and observe correlations between cyber-attacks. Finally we provide future work on Security Visualization with Augmented Reality capabilities to enhance and improve user interactions with the security visualization platform.",Security Visualization;Cyber-attacks;Usercentricity;Data Provenance;Datasets

Web of Science,journalPaper,2023,Virtually secure: A taxonomic assessment of cybersecurity challenges in virtual reality environments,CS - Computers and Security,B,"Although Virtual Reality (VR) is certainly not a new technology, its recent adoption across several sectors beyond entertainment has led the information security research community to take note of the new cy-ber threats that come with it. The variety of system components presents an extensive attack surface that can be exploited. At the same time, VR's emphasis on immersion, interaction and presence means that the user can be targeted directly, yet the use of head-mounted displays may prevent them from observing a cyber attack's impact in their immediate physical environment. This paper presents the first taxonomic representation of VR security challenges. By systemically classifying existing VR cyber threats against ex-isting defences in a single comparative matrix, we aim to help researchers from different backgrounds to identify key focus areas where further research would be most beneficial.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Web of Science,journalPaper,2023,A systematic threat analysis and defense strategies for the metaverse and extended reality systems,CS - Computers and Security,B,"With the rapid development and evolution of immersive technologies there are growing concerns of security and privacy threats to the metaverse and extended reality (XR) systems. Immersive reality solutions are a combination of multiple vulnerable technologies allowing attackers to easily undermine security. Furthermore the deployment of appropriate security controls and defensive mechanisms for resource constrained proprietary XR products has been limited. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of extended reality systems and the metaverse with emphasis on technology weaknesses, cyber security challenges and users' safety concerns. Five major taxonomies have been presented in this research with an aim of identifying privacy inference vectors and potential cyber threats; determining the impact on human health and the extent to which cyberstalking, and digital currency scam activities proliferate when using XR. This research also proposes strategies for primary lines of defense and provides recommendations on the adoption of safety measures.",Extended reality (XR); Metaverse; Cyber defense; Privacy; Cyber threats; Cyberstalking; Physical safety; XR commerce; Virtual reality; Augmented reality; Mixed reality; Blockchain; Cybersickness; Currency scams
Web of Science,journalPaper,2023,Rise of the Metaverse?s Immersive Virtual Reality Malware and the Man-in-the-Room Attack & Defenses,CS - Computers and Security,B,"The allure of the metaverse along with Virtual Reality (VR) technologies and speed at which they are deployed may shift focus away from security and privacy fundamentals. In this work we employ classic exploitation techniques against cutting edge devices to obtain equally novel results. The unique features of the Virtual Reality landscape set the stage for our primary account of a new attack, the Man-in-the-Room (MitR). This attack, realized from a vulnerable social networking application led to both worming and botnet capabilities being adapted for VR with potential critical impacts affecting millions of users. Our work improves the state-of-the-art in Virtual Reality (VR) security and socio-technical research in VR. It shares several analytical and attacking tools, example exploits, evaluation dataset, and vulnerability signatures with the scientific and professional communities to ensure secure VR software development. The presented results demonstrate the detection and prevention of VR vulnerabilities, and raise questions in the law and policy domains pertaining to VR security and privacy.

Web of Science,journalPaper,2023,Virtual reality for improving cyber situational awareness in security operations centers,CS - Computers and Security,B,"Security operations centers (SOCs) are the 911 centers of many organizational networks, except they not only respond, but also monitor. SOC operators are charged with detection, response, and mitigation. This is a tall task when one considers the volume, velocity, and variety of both internal and external organizational network and system data. SOC operations are truly a big data problem. Security orchestration, incident event management, data fusion, and anomaly detection systems help, but more is needed. This study examines the impact virtual reality (VR) can have on SOC operator performance and perceived task load. We developed a VR based network monitoring tool and assigned human subjects to one of three conditions - VR only, traditional tool only, or both. Our results, though small in scale, provide very promising indication that VR based technology may be beneficial for improving cyber situational awareness (SA), particularly with overall data perception involving novice SOC operators. The results are promising, but the sample size is small, so future research should validate this pilot study. Given the workforce challenges in the cybersecurity space, and the need to perceive large quantities of data, VR may be a very good addition to SOCs.",Cyber situational awareness; Virtual reality; Security operations centers; Network monitoring
