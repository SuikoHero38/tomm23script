Web of Science,conferencePaper,2017,HoloPair: Securing Shared Augmented Reality Using Microsoft HoloLens,ACSAC - Annual Computer Security Applications Conference,A,"Augmented Reality (AR) devices continuously scan their environment in order to naturally overlay virtual objects onto user's view of the physical world. In contrast to Virtual Reality, where one's environment is fully replaced with a virtual one, one of AR's killer features is co-located collaboration, in which multiple users interact with the same combination of virtual and real objects. Microsoft recently released HoloLens, the first consumer-ready augmented reality headset that needs no outside markers to achieve precise inside-out spatial mapping, which allows centimeter-scale hologram positioning. However, despite many applications published on the Windows Mixed Reality platform that rely on direct communication between AR devices, there currently exists no implementation or achievable proposal for secure direct pairing of two unassociated headsets. As augmented reality gets into mainstream, this omission exposes current and future users to a range of avoidable attacks. In order to close this real-world gap in both theory and engineering practice, in this paper we design and evaluate HoloPair, a system for secure and usable pairing of two AR headsets. We propose a pairing protocol and build a working prototype to experimentally evaluate its security guarantees, usability, and system performance. By running a user study with a total of 22 participants, we show that the system achieves high rates of attack detection, short pairing times, and a high average usability score. Moreover, in order to make an immediate impact on the wider developer community, we have published the full implementation and source code of our prototype, which is currently under consideration to be included in the official HoloLens development toolkit.",

Such an authentication system can capture the hand movement of writing a passcode string in the air and verify the user identity using both the writing content (like a password) and the writing style (like a behavior biometric trait)Â â€¦",
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2019,A First Look into Privacy Leakage in 3D Mixed Reality Data,ESORICS - European Symposium on Research in Computer Security,A,"We have seen a rise in mixed (MR) and augmented reality (AR) applications and devices in recent years. Subsequently, we have become familiar with the sensing power of these applications and devices, and we are only starting to realize the nascent risks that these technology puts over our privacy and security. Current privacy protection measures are primarily aimed towards known and well-utilised data types (i.e. location, on-line activity, biometric, and so on) while a few works have focused on looking into the security and privacy risks of and providing protection on MR data, particularly on 3D MR data. In this work, we primarily reveal the privacy leakage from released 3D MR data and how the leakage persist even after implementing spatial generalizations and abstractions. Firstly, we formalize the spatial privacy problem in 3D mixed reality data as well as the adversary model. Then, we demonstrate through an inference model how adversaries can identify 3D spaces and, potentially, infer more spatial information. Moreover, we also demonstrate how compact 3D MR Data can be in terms of memory usage which allows adversaries to create lightweight 3D inference models of user spaces.",Mixed and augmented reality; 3D data; Point cloud data; Security and privacy
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2015,Visual Cryptography and Obfuscation: A Use-Case for Decrypting and Deobfuscating Information Using Augmented Reality,FC - Financial Cryptography and Data Security,A,"As new technologies emerge such as wearables, it opens up for new challenges, especially related to security and privacy. One such recent technology is smart glasses. The use of glasses introduces security and privacy concerns for the general public but also for the user itself. In this paper we present work which focus on privacy of the user during authentication. We propose and analyze two methods, visual cryptography and obfuscation for protecting the user against HUD and camera logging adversaries as well as shoulder-surfing.",Visual cryptography; Visual obfuscation; Augmented reality; Wearables
Web of Science,conferencePaper,2015,Design and Analysis of Shoulder Surfing Resistant PIN Based Authentication Mechanisms on Google Glass,FC - Financial Cryptography and Data Security,A,"This paper explores options to the built-in authentication mechanism of the Google Glass which is vulnerable to shoulder surfing attacks. Two simple PIN-based authentication techniques are presented, both of which provide protection against shoulder surfing. The techniques employ two interfaces for entering the PIN, namely, voice (Voice-based PIN) and touchpad (Touch-based PIN). To enter the same PIN, user has the freedom to choose either technique and thereby interface, as per the environment in which authentication is being performed. A user study was conducted with 30 participants to compare the performance of the proposed methods with the built-in technique. The results show that the proposed mechanisms have a significantly better login success rate than the built-in technique. Interestingly, although the average authentication times of the proposed methods are higher than that of the built-in one, the users perceived them as being faster. The results also indicate that the proposed methods have better perceived security and usability than the built-in method. The study reveals that when it comes to authentication on augmented reality devices, there is a need for authentication mechanisms that complement each other as users tend to prefer a different interface in different contexts.",Google Glass; PIN; Authentication; Security; Usability
Web of Science,journalPaper,2019,GaitLock: Protect Virtual and Augmented Reality Headsets Using Gait,TODSC -Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,A,"With the fast penetration of commercial Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) systems into our daily life, the security issues of those devices have attracted significant interests from both academia and industry. Modern VR/AR systems typically use head-mounted devices (i.e., headsets) to interact with users, and often store private user data, e.g., social network accounts, online transactions or even payment information. This poses significant security threats, since in practice the headset can be potentially obtained and accessed by unauthenticated parties, e.g., identity thieves, and thus cause catastrophic breach. In this paper, we propose a novel GaitLock system, which can reliably authenticate users using their gait signatures. Our system doesn't require extra hardware, e.g., fingerprint sensors or retina scanners, but only uses the on-board inertial measurement units (IMUs) equipped in almost all mainstream VR/AR headsets to authenticate the legitimate users from intruders, by simply asking them to walk a few steps. To achieve that, we propose a new gait recognition model Dynamic-SRC, which combines the strength of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Sparse Representation Classifier (SRC), to extract unique gait patterns from the inertial signals during walking. We implement GaitLock on Google Glass (a typical AR headset), and extensive experiments show that GaitLock outperforms the state-of-the-art systems significantly in recognition accuracy (> 98 percent success in 5 steps), and is able to run in-situ on the resource-constrained VR/AR headsets without incurring high energy cost.",Gait recognition; VR/AR; sparse representation classification; dynamic time warping
Web of Science,journalPaper,2021,Immersive Virtual Reality Attacks and the Human Joystick,TODSC -Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,A,"This is one of the first accounts for the security analysis of consumer immersive Virtual Reality (VR) systems. This work breaks new ground, coins new terms, and constructs proof of concept implementations of attacks related to immersive VR. Our work used the two most widely adopted immersive VR systems, the HTC Vive, and the Oculus Rift. More specifically, we were able to create attacks that can potentially disorient users, turn their Head Mounted Display (HMD) camera on without their knowledge, overlay images in their field of vision, and modify VR environmental factors that force them into hitting physical objects and walls. Finally, we illustrate through a human participant deception study the success of being able to exploit VR systems to control immersed users and move them to a location in physical space without their knowledge. We term this the Human Joystick Attack. We conclude our work with future research directions and ways to enhance the security of these systems.",Security; Virtual reality; Software; Tracking; Cameras; Testing; Resists; Computer security; human computer interaction; privacy-invasive software; virtual reality
Web of Science,journalPaper,2022,Modeling and Defense of Social Virtual Reality Attacks Inducing Cybersickness,TODSC -Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,A,"Social Virtual Reality Learning Environments (VRLE) offer a new medium for flexible and immersive learning environments with geo-distributed users. Ensuring user safety in VRLE application domains such as education, flight simulations, military training is of utmost importance. Specifically, there is a need to study the impact of immersion attacks (e.g., chaperone attack, occlusion) and other types of attacks/faults (e.g., unauthorized access, network congestion) that may cause user safety issues (i.e., inducing of cybersickness). In this article, we present a novel framework to quantify the security, privacy issues triggered via immersion attacks and other types of attacks/faults. By using a real-world social VRLE viz., vSocial and creating a novel attack-fault tree model, we show that such attacks can induce undesirable levels of cybersickness. Next, we convert these attack-fault trees into stochastic timed automata (STA) representations to perform statistical model checking for a given attacker profile. Using this model checking approach, we determine the most vulnerable threat scenarios that can trigger high occurrence cases of cybersickness for VRLE users. Lastly, we show the effectiveness of our attack-fault tree modeling by incorporating suitable design principles such as hardening, diversity, redundancy and principle of least privilege to ensure user safety in a VRLE session.",Cybersickness; Security; Privacy; Safety; Solid modeling; Servers; Virtual environments; Security and privacy; user safety; cybersickness; virtual reality learning environments; attack-fault trees; statistical model checking; risk assessment; design principles
Web of Science,journalPaper,2015,3D-Model-Based Video Analysis for Computer Generated Faces Identification,TOIFS - Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,A,"Modern computer graphics technologies brought realism in computer-generated characters, making them achieve truly natural appearance. Besides traditional virtual reality applications such as avatars, games, or cinema, these synthetic characters may be used to generate realistic fakes, which may lead to improper use of the technology. This fact raises the demand for advanced tools able to discriminate real and artificial human faces in digital media. In this paper, we propose a method to distinguish between computer generated and natural faces by modeling and evaluating their dynamic behavior. Because of a 3D-model-based video analysis, the proposed technique allows identifying synthetic characters by detecting their more limited variability over time. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach also on very challenging and realistic video sequences.",Computer generated versus natural; facial analysis; video forensics
Web of Science,journalPaper,2021,Designing Leakage-Resilient Password Entry on Head-Mounted Smart Wearable Glass Devices,TOIFS - Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,A,"With the boom of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, head-mounted smart wearable glass devices are becoming popular to help users access various services like E-mail freely. However, most existing password entry schemes on smart glasses rely on additional computers or mobile devices connected to smart glasses, which require users to switch between different systems and devices. This may greatly lower the practicability and usability of smart glasses. In this paper, we focus on this challenge and design three practical anti-eavesdropping password entry schemes on stand-alone smart glasses, named gTapper, gRotator and gTalker. The main idea is to break the correlation between the underlying password and the interaction observable to adversaries. In our IRB-approved user study, these schemes are found to be easy-to-use without additional hardware under various test conditions, where the participants can enter their passwords within moderate time, at high accuracy, and in various situations.",Password; Smart glasses; Eavesdropping; Usability; Glass; Authentication; Password entry; anti-eavesdropping; smart glasses; head-mounted device; usability and security
Web of Science,journalPaper,2023,A Secure Authentication Framework to Guarantee the Traceability of Avatars in Metaverse,TOIFS - Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,A,"Metaverse is a vast virtual environment parallel to the physical world in which users enjoy a variety of services acting as an avatar. To build a secure living habitat, it's vital to ensure the virtual-physical traceability that tracking a malicious player in the physical world via his avatars in virtual space. In this paper, we propose a two-factor authentication framework based on biometric-based authentication and chameleon signature. First, aiming at disguise in virtual space, we design an avatar's two-factor identity model to ensure the verifiability of avatar's virtual identity and physical identity. Second, facing at authentication efficiency and keys holding cost, we propose a chameleon collision signature algorithm to efficiently ensure that the avatar's virtual identity is associated with its physical identity. Finally, aiming at impersonation in the physical world, we design two decentralized authentication protocols based on the avatar's identity model and the chameleon collision signature to achieve real-time authentication on the avatar's identity. Security analysis indicates that the proposed authentication framework guarantees the consistency and traceability of the avatar's identity. Simulation experiments show that the framework not only completes the decentralized authentication between avatars but also achieves virtual-physical tracking.",Metaverse; avatar; authentication; traceability
Web of Science,journalPaper,2020,Mimicry Attacks on Smartphone Keystroke Authentication,TOPS - Transactions on Privacy and Security,A,"Keystroke behaviour-based authentication employs the unique typing behaviour of users to authenticate them. Recent such proposals for virtual keyboards on smartphones employ diverse temporal, contact, and spatial features to achieve over 95% accuracy. Consequently, they have been suggested as a second line of defense with text-based password authentication. We show that a state-of-the-art keystroke behaviour-based authentication scheme is highly vulnerable against mimicry attacks. While previous research used training interfaces to attack physical keyboards, we show that this approach has limited effectiveness against virtual keyboards. This is mainly due to the large number of diverse features that the attacker needs to mimic for virtual keyboards. We address this challenge by developing an augmented reality-based app that resides on the attacker's smartphone and leverages computer vision and keystroke data to provide real-time guidance during password entry on the victim's phone. In addition, we propose an audiovisual attack in which the attacker overlays transparent film printed with spatial pointers on the victim's device and uses audio cues to match the temporal behaviour of the victim. Both attacks require neither tampering or installing software on the victim's device nor specialized hardware. We conduct experiments with 30 users to mount over 400 mimicry attacks. We show that our methods enable an attacker to mimic keystroke behaviour on virtual keyboards with little effort. We also demonstrate the extensibility of our augmented reality-based technique by successfully mounting mimicry attacks on a swiping behaviour-based continuous authentication system.",Mimicry attacks; authentication; behavioural biometrics; spoofing attacks; augmented reality
Web of Science,journalPaper,2022,Hidden in Plain Sight: Exploring Privacy Risks of Mobile Augmented Reality Applications,TOPS - Transactions on Privacy and Security,A,"Mobile augmented reality systems are becoming increasingly common and powerful, with applications in such domains as healthcare, manufacturing, education, and more. This rise in popularity is thanks in part to the functionalities offered by commercially available vision libraries such as ARCore, Vuforia, and Google's ML Kit; however, these libraries also give rise to the possibility of a hidden operations threat, that is, the ability of a malicious or incompetent application developer to conduct additional vision operations behind the scenes of an otherwise honest AR application without alerting the end-user. In this article, we present the privacy risks associated with the hidden operations threat and propose a framework for application development and runtime permissions targeted specifically at preventing the execution of hidden operations. We follow this with a set of experimental results, exploring the feasibility and utility of our system in differentiating between user-expectation-compliant and non-compliant AR applications during runtime testing, for which preliminary results demonstrate accuracy of up to 71%. We conclude with a discussion of open problems in the areas of software testing and privacy standards in mobile AR systems.",Augmented reality; mobile system security; user privacy
