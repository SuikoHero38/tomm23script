Web of Science,journalPaper,2023,Virtually secure: A taxonomic assessment of cybersecurity challenges in virtual reality environments,CS - Computers and Security,B,"Although Virtual Reality (VR) is certainly not a new technology, its recent adoption across several sectors beyond entertainment has led the information security research community to take note of the new cy-ber threats that come with it. The variety of system components presents an extensive attack surface that can be exploited. At the same time, VR's emphasis on immersion, interaction and presence means that the user can be targeted directly, yet the use of head-mounted displays may prevent them from observing a cyber attack's impact in their immediate physical environment. This paper presents the first taxonomic representation of VR security challenges. By systemically classifying existing VR cyber threats against ex-isting defences in a single comparative matrix, we aim to help researchers from different backgrounds to identify key focus areas where further research would be most beneficial.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Web of Science,journalPaper,2023,A systematic threat analysis and defense strategies for the metaverse and extended reality systems,CS - Computers and Security,B,"With the rapid development and evolution of immersive technologies there are growing concerns of security and privacy threats to the metaverse and extended reality (XR) systems. Immersive reality solutions are a combination of multiple vulnerable technologies allowing attackers to easily undermine security. Furthermore the deployment of appropriate security controls and defensive mechanisms for resource constrained proprietary XR products has been limited. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of extended reality systems and the metaverse with emphasis on technology weaknesses, cyber security challenges and users' safety concerns. Five major taxonomies have been presented in this research with an aim of identifying privacy inference vectors and potential cyber threats; determining the impact on human health and the extent to which cyberstalking, and digital currency scam activities proliferate when using XR. This research also proposes strategies for primary lines of defense and provides recommendations on the adoption of safety measures.",Extended reality (XR); Metaverse; Cyber defense; Privacy; Cyber threats; Cyberstalking; Physical safety; XR commerce; Virtual reality; Augmented reality; Mixed reality; Blockchain; Cybersickness; Currency scams
Web of Science,journalPaper,2023,Rise of the Metaverse?s Immersive Virtual Reality Malware and the Man-in-the-Room Attack & Defenses,CS - Computers and Security,B,"The allure of the metaverse along with Virtual Reality (VR) technologies and speed at which they are deployed may shift focus away from security and privacy fundamentals. In this work we employ classic exploitation techniques against cutting edge devices to obtain equally novel results. The unique features of the Virtual Reality landscape set the stage for our primary account of a new attack, the Man-in-the-Room (MitR). This attack, realized from a vulnerable social networking application led to both worming and botnet capabilities being adapted for VR with potential critical impacts affecting millions of users. Our work improves the state-of-the-art in Virtual Reality (VR) security and socio-technical research in VR. It shares several analytical and attacking tools, example exploits, evaluation dataset, and vulnerability signatures with the scientific and professional communities to ensure secure VR software development. The presented results demonstrate the detection and prevention of VR vulnerabilities, and raise questions in the law and policy domains pertaining to VR security and privacy.

Web of Science,journalPaper,2023,Virtual reality for improving cyber situational awareness in security operations centers,CS - Computers and Security,B,"Security operations centers (SOCs) are the 911 centers of many organizational networks, except they not only respond, but also monitor. SOC operators are charged with detection, response, and mitigation. This is a tall task when one considers the volume, velocity, and variety of both internal and external organizational network and system data. SOC operations are truly a big data problem. Security orchestration, incident event management, data fusion, and anomaly detection systems help, but more is needed. This study examines the impact virtual reality (VR) can have on SOC operator performance and perceived task load. We developed a VR based network monitoring tool and assigned human subjects to one of three conditions - VR only, traditional tool only, or both. Our results, though small in scale, provide very promising indication that VR based technology may be beneficial for improving cyber situational awareness (SA), particularly with overall data perception involving novice SOC operators. The results are promising, but the sample size is small, so future research should validate this pilot study. Given the workforce challenges in the cybersecurity space, and the need to perceive large quantities of data, VR may be a very good addition to SOCs.",Cyber situational awareness; Virtual reality; Security operations centers; Network monitoring
